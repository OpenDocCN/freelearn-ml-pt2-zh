- en: Starting with installing and setting up scikit-learn, this book contains highly
    practical recipes on common supervised and unsupervised machine learning concepts.
    Acquire your data for analysis; select the necessary features for your model;
    and implement popular techniques such as linear models, classification, regression,
    clustering, and more in no time at all! The book also contains recipes on evaluating
    and fine-tuning the performance of your model. The recipes contain both the underlying
    motivations and theory for trying a technique, plus all the code in detail.

- en: scikit-learn and Python allow fast prototyping, which is in a sense the opposite
    of Donald Knuth's premature optimization. Personally, scikit-learn has allowed
    me to prototype what I once thought was impossible, including large-scale facial
    recognition systems and stock market trading simulations. You can gain instant
    insights and build prototypes with scikit-learn. Data science is, by definition,
    scientific and has many failed hypotheses. Thankfully, with scikit-learn you can
    see what works (and what does not) within the next few minutes.

    welcoming to beginners and experts alike and encourages a new scientific software
    engineering mindset. This welcoming nature is refreshing because, in innovation,
    we are all beginners.

    transitions from a scripting language to more of an object-oriented language.
    The Python data science ecosystem has the basic components for you to make your
    own unique style and contribute heavily to the data science team and artificial
    intelligence.

    of different styles vote to make better predictions. Some make better choices
    than others, but as long as the algorithms are different, the choice in the end
    will be the best. Stackers and blenders came to prominence in the Netflix $1 million
    prize competition won by the team Pragmatic Chaos.

    Machine Learning – NumPy*, features your first machine learning algorithm with
    support vector machines. We distinguish between classification (what type?) and
    regression (how much?). We predict an outcome on data we have not seen.'

    and Pre-Processing*, exposes a realistic industrial setting with plenty of data
    munging and pre-processing. To do machine learning, you need good data, and this
    chapter tells you how to get it and get it into good form for machine learning.'

    scikit-learn*, tells the story of linear regression, the oldest predictive model,
    from the machine learning and artificial intelligence lenses. You deal with correlated
    features with ridge regression, eliminate related features with LASSO and cross-validation,
    or eliminate outliers with robust median-based regression.'

    between regression and classification, the two types of supervised learning.'

    as distance is synonymous with similarity. How close (similar) or far away are
    two points? Can we group them together? With Euclid''s help, we can approach unsupervised
    learning with k-means clustering and place points in categories we do not know
    in advance.'

    Each layer figures out a step in a process, leading to a desired outcome. As we
    do not program any steps specifically, we venture into artificial intelligence.
    Save the neural network so that you can keep training it later, or load it and
