    is undefined, and the logarithm of a negative number gives us imaginary values.
    Thus, the logarithmic transformation is usually applied when dealing with non-negative
    targets. One other trick to make sure that we do not encounter `log(0)` is to
    add 1 to all your target values before transforming them, then subtract 1 after
    transforming your predictions back. Similarly, for the square root transformation,
    we have to make sure not to have negative targets in the first place.

    probabilities. In other words, we do not care much about the model's overall precision,
    since we only care about its precision for the top `k` samples.

    explain the code to you in detail. The `zip()` method combines the two lists and
    returns a list of tuples. The first tuple in the list will contain the first item
    of `y_true` along with the first item of `y_pred_proba`. The second tuple will
    hold the second item of each of them, and so on. Then, I sorted the list of tuples
    in descending order (`reverse=True`) based on the second items of the tuples,
    that is, `y_pred_proba`.Then, I took the top `k` items of the sorted list of tuples
    and compared the `y_true` part of them to the `pos_label` parameter. The `pos_label`
    parameter allows me to decide which label to base my precision calculations on.
    Finally, I calculated the ratio of items in `topk`where an actual member of the
    class specified by`pos_label` is captured.

    overall precision of `62%` for all the positively classified samples. Once more,
    your results may differ from mine.

    data or classes that aren't easy to separate, and you only care about the model's
    accuracy for the top few predictions. It allows you to tune your model to capture
    the samples that matter the most. I bet Google cares about the search results
    you see on the first page way more than the results on the 80^(th) page. And if
    I only have money to buy 20 stocks in the stock exchange, I would like a model
    that gets the top 20 stocks right, and I wouldn't care much about its accuracy
    for the 100^(th) stock.

    by thinking about the features we should include in our models. Nonetheless, it
    is often that the key to the solution lies in the target values. As we have seen
    in this chapter, rescaling our regression target can help us use a simpler model.
    Furthermore, calibrating the probabilities given by our classifiers may quickly
    give a boost to our accuracy scores and help us quantify our uncertainties. We
    also learned how to deal with multiple targets by writing a single estimator to
    predict multiple outputs at once. This helps to simplify our code and allows the
    estimator to use the knowledge it learns from one label to predict the others.

    When detecting fraudulent incidents, the majority of your data is usually comprised
    of non-fraudulent cases. Similarly, for problems such as who would click on your
    advertisement, and who would subscribe to your newsletter, it is always the minority
    class that is more interesting for you to detect.
