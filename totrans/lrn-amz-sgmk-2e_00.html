			<p>Amazon SageMaker enables you to quickly build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale without managing any infrastructure. It helps you focus on the machine learning problem at hand and deploy high-quality models by eliminating the heavy lifting typically involved in each step of the ML process. This second edition will help data scientists and ML developers to explore new features, such as SageMaker Data Wrangler, Pipelines, Clarify, Feature Store, and much more.</p>
			<p>You'll start by learning how to use various capabilities of SageMaker as a single toolset to solve ML challenges and progress to cover features such as AutoML, built-in algorithms and frameworks, and writing your own code and algorithms to build ML models. The book will then show you how to integrate Amazon SageMaker with popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, to extend the capabilities of existing models. You'll see how automating your workflows can help you get to production faster with minimum effort and at a lower cost. Finally, you'll explore SageMaker Debugger and SageMaker Model Monitor to detect quality issues in training and production.</p>
			<p>By the end of this Amazon book, you'll be able to use Amazon SageMaker on the full spectrum of ML workflows, from experimentation, training, and monitoring to scaling, deployment, and automation.</p>
			<h1 id="_idParaDest-6"><a id="_idTextAnchor005"/>Who this book is for</h1>
			<p>This book is for software engineers, machine learning developers, data scientists, and AWS users who are new to using Amazon SageMaker and want to build high-quality machine learning models without worrying about infrastructure. Knowledge of AWS basics is required to grasp the concepts covered in this book more effectively. A solid understanding of machine learning concepts and the Python programming language will also be beneficial.</p>
