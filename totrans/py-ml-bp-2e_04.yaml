- en: Before we jump in and begin modeling, let's first discuss what an IPO, or initial
    public offering, is, and what research tells us about this market. After that,
    we'll discuss a number of strategies that we can apply.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is an IPO?
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An IPO is the process whereby a private company becomes a public company. Public
    offerings raise capital for the company and give the general public an opportunity
    to invest in the company by buying its shares.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Though there are variations in how this occurs, in a typical offering, a company
    enlists the help of one or more investment banks to underwrite their offering.
    This means that the banks make a guarantee to the company that they will purchase
    all of the shares being offered at the IPO price on the day of the IPO. The underwriters,
    of course, do not intend to keep all of the shares themselves. With the help of
    the offering company, they go on what's called a **roadshow** to drum up interest
    from institutional clients. These clients put in a **subscription** for the shares,
    which indicates their interest in buying shares on the day of the IPO. This is
    a non-binding contract, as the price of the offering is not finalized until the
    day of the IPO. The underwriter will then set the offer price, given the level
    of interest expressed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What is interesting from our perspective is that research has consistently shown
    a systematic underpricing of IPOs. There are a number of theories as to why this
    happens, and why this level of underpricing seems to vary over time, but studies
    have shown that billions of dollars are left on the table every year.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In an IPO, **money left on the table**, is the difference between the offering
    price of shares and the first day's closing price.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One other point that should be mentioned before we move on is the difference
    between the offering price and the opening price. While you can occasionally get
    in on the deal through your broker and receive the IPO at its offering price,
    in nearly all instances, you, as a member of the general public, will have to
    purchase the IPO at the (typically higher) opening price. We'll build our models
    under this assumption.

    The dropped column then becomes the **base case**. All the other cases are then
    compared to that case. In our IPO example using months as predictors, we will
    drop January, for example, and then all the other months will be judged against
    January's performance. The same goes for the days of the week or any other categorical
    predictor. This dropping of a column is to prevent multicollinearity, which would
    have a negative impact on the explanatory power of the model.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the nice features of logistic regression is that it offers predictor
    coefficients that can tell us the relative importance of the predictor variables
    or features. For categorical features, a positive sign on a feature's coefficient
    tells us that, when present, this feature increases the probability of a positive
    outcome versus the baseline. For continuous features, a positive sign tells us
    that an increase in the value of a feature corresponds to an increase in the probability
    of a positive outcome. The size of the coefficient tells us the magnitude of the
    increase in probability.

    or the base case. All the other days of the week would be compared to Monday.
    From the preceding screenshot, we see that Thursday appears to be the best day
    of the week. Saturday appears to be a terrible day of the week to have an IPO,
    most likely because the market is closed that day. (In all likelihood, those dates
    are just incorrectly recorded.)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking further at the features with the highest coefficients, we can now appreciate
    that extracting useful information for the predictive value of each is difficult,
    since many of those features are for things that no longer exist. For example,
    while Deutsche Bank still exists, it no longer underwrites as Deutsche Banc Alex.
    Brown, so that is actually conveying historical information rather than information
    that can be useful going forward.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another issue is that features do not reflect how frequently they had an impact.
    The appearance of a bank that was only in business in 2000 and had 3 hugely successful
    IPOs would have a very large positive coefficient, but would be meaningless in
    our modeling efforts.
