    numerous communities in the country that you live in and the government is trying
    to figure out how to confront this health emergency. Critical to any plan to confront
    this health emergency is epidemiological knowledge, including where the patients
    are located and how the disease is moving. The ability to locate and quantify
    problem areas (which are classically referred to as hotspots) can help health
    professionals, policy makers, and emergency response teams craft the most effective
    and efficient strategies for combating the disease. This scenario highlights one
    of the many applications of hotspot modeling.'

    is a useful technique since it can be used to determine the distribution of certain
    demographic characteristics. By demographic characteristics we mean that we could
    find the geographic distribution of high school graduates, immigrants from a specific

    estimation. Kernel density estimation builds an estimated density using sample
    data and two parameters known as the **kernel function** and the **bandwidth value**.
    The estimated density is, like any distribution, essentially a guideline for the
    behavior of a random variable. Here, we mean how frequently the random variable
    takes on any specific value, ![](img/C12626_09_Formula_01.png). When dealing with
    hotspot analysis where the data is typically geographic, the estimated density
    answers the question *How frequently do specific longitude and latitude pairs
    appear?*. If a specific longitude and latitude pair, ![](img/C12626_09_Formula_02.png),
    and other nearby pairs occur with high frequency, then the estimated density built
    using the sample data will be expected to show that the area around the longitude
    and latitude pair has a high likelihood.

    process of estimating a density is the process of estimating the underlying shape
    of the data by disregarding the eccentricities and anomalies in the sample data.
    Stated another way, kernel density estimation removes the noise from the data.
    The only assumption of the model is that the data truly belongs to some interpretable
    and meaningful density from which insights can be derived and acted upon. That
    is, there exists a true underlying distribution.

    to make inferences about the population. We assume that the sample data contains
    clusters of data points and that these clusters imply regions of high likelihood
    in the true population. A benefit of creating a quality estimate of the true population
    density is that the estimated density can then be used to sample more data from
    the population.

    value** and its impact on the quality of the estimate cannot be overestimated.
    A high-level definition of the bandwidth value is that it is a value that determines
    the degree of smoothing. If the bandwidth value is low, then the estimated density
    will feature limited smoothing, which means that the density will capture all
    the noise in the sample data. If the bandwidth value is high, then the estimated
    density will be very smooth. An overly smooth density will remove characteristics
    of the true density from the estimated density, which are legitimate and not simply
    noise.

- en: In more statistical or machine learning languages, the bandwidth parameter controls
    the bias-variance trade-off. That is, high variance is the result of low bandwidth
    values because the density is sensitive to the variance of the sample data. Low
    bandwidth values limit any ability the model may have had to adapt to and work
    around gaps in the sample data that are not present in the population. Densities
    estimated using low bandwidth values tend to overfit the data (this is also known
    as under-smoothed densities). When high bandwidth values are used, then the resulting
    density is underfit and the estimated density has a high bias (this is also known
    as over-smoothed densities).

    a plug-in method (or a formulaic approach) that is deterministic and not optimized
    on the sample data. Plug-in methods are generally much faster to implement, simpler
    to code, and easier to explain. However, these methods have one big downside,
    which is that their accuracy tends to suffer compared to approaches that are optimized
    on the sample data. These methods also have distributional assumptions. The most
    popular plug-in methods are Silverman's Rule and Scott's Rule. By default, the
    `seaborn` package (which will be used in future exercises) uses Scott's Rule as
    the method to determine the bandwidth value.

- en: The second, and arguably the more robust, approach to finding an optimal bandwidth
    value is by searching a predefined grid of bandwidth values. Grid search is an
    empirical approach that is used frequently in machine learning and predictive
    modeling to optimize model hyperparameters. The process starts by defining the
    bandwidth grid, which is simply the collection of bandwidth values to be evaluated.
    Use each bandwidth value in the grid to create an estimated density; then, score
    the estimated density using the pseudo-log-likelihood value. The optimal bandwidth
    value is that which has the maximum pseudo-log-likelihood value. Think of the
    pseudo-log-likelihood value as the result of the probability of getting data points
    where we did get data points and the probability of not getting points where we
    did not get any data points. Ideally, both of these probabilities would be large.
    Consider the case where the probability of getting data points where we did get
    points is low. In this situation, the implication would be that the data points
    in the sample were anomalous because, under the true distribution, getting points
    where we did would not be expected with a high likelihood value.

    up-weighted, whereas data points that are alone or far away from any other data
    points are down-weighted. Up-weighted data points will correspond to points of

    densities with different kernels is less than the difference between the estimated

    during the model building process.

    by intuition. Kernel density estimation turns each data point in the sample into
    its own distribution whose width is controlled by the bandwidth value. The individual
    distributions are then summed to create the desired density estimate. This concept
    is fairly easy to demonstrate; however, before doing that in the next exercise,
    let's try to think through it in an abstract way. For geographic regions containing
    many sample data points, the individual densities will overlap and, through the
    process of summing those densities, will create points of high likelihood in the
    estimated density. Similarly, for geographic regions containing few to no sample
    data points, the individual densities will not overlap and, therefore, will correspond
    to points of low likelihood in the estimated density.

    areas in the previous density was southern California, but southern California
    is a huge area with an enormous population and many municipalities. Bear in mind

- en: 'Kernel density estimation is a classic statistical technique that is in the
    same family of techniques as the histogram. It allows the user to extrapolate
    out from sample data to make insights and predictions about the population of
    particular objects or events. This extrapolation comes in the form of a probability
    density function, which is nice because the results read as likelihoods or probabilities.
    The quality of this model is dependent on two parameters: the bandwidth value
    and the kernel function. As discussed, the most crucial component of leveraging
    kernel density estimation successfully is the setting of an optimal bandwidth.
    Optimal bandwidths are most frequently identified using grid search cross-validation
    with pseudo-log-likelihood as the scoring metric. What makes kernel density estimation
    great is both its simplicity and its applicability to so many fields.'
