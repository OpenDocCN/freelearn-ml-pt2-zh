- en: Machine learning, at its core, is concerned with the algorithms that transform
    information into actionable intelligence. This fact makes machine learning well-suited
    to the present-day era of big data. Without machine learning, it would be nearly
    impossible to keep up with the massive stream of information.

- en: Given the growing prominence of R—a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming
    environment—there has never been a better time to start using machine learning.
    R offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of tools that can assist you with finding
    data insights.
