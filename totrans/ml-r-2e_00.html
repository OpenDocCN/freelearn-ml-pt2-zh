This fact makes machine learning well-suited to the present-day era of big data. Without machine learning, it would be nearly impossible to keep up with the massive stream of information.</p><p>Given the growing prominence of R—a cross-platform, zero-cost statistical programming environment—there has never been a better time to start using machine learning. R offers a powerful but easy-to-learn set of tools that can assist you with finding data insights.</p><p>By combining hands-on case studies with the essential theory that you need to understand how things work under the hood, this book provides all the knowledge that you will need to start applying machine learning to your own projects.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>

<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Finding Patterns – Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finding Patterns – Market Basket Analysis Using Association Rules</em></span>, exposes the algorithm used in the recommendation systems employed by many retailers. If you've ever wondered how retailers seem to know your purchasing habits better than you know yourself, this chapter will reveal their secrets.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Finding Groups of Data – Clustering with k-means">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Finding Groups of Data – Clustering with k-means</em></span>, is devoted to a procedure that locates clusters of related items. We'll utilize this algorithm to identify profiles within an online community.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Evaluating Model Performance">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Evaluating Model Performance</em></span>, provides information on measuring the success of a machine learning project and obtaining a reliable estimate of the learner's performance on future data.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Improving Model Performance">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Improving Model Performance</em></span>, reveals the methods employed by the teams at the top of machine learning competition leaderboards. If you have a competitive streak, or simply want to get the most out of your data, you'll need to add these techniques to your repertoire.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Specialized Machine Learning Topics">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Specialized Machine Learning Topics</em></span>, explores the frontiers of machine learning. From working with big data to making R work faster, the topics covered will help you push the boundaries of what is possible with R.</p></div></div>
<div class="section" title="What you need for this book"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec03"/>What you need for this book</h1></div></div></div><p>The examples in this book were written for and tested with R version 3.2.0 on Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, though they are likely to work with any recent version of R.</p></div>
<div class="section" title="Who this book is for"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec04"/>Who this book is for</h1></div></div></div><p>This book is intended for anybody hoping to use data for action. Perhaps you already know a bit about machine learning, but have never used R; or perhaps you know a little about R, but are new to machine learning. In any case, this book will get you up and running quickly. It would be helpful to have a bit of familiarity with basic math and programming concepts, but no prior experience is required. All you need is curiosity.</p></div>
