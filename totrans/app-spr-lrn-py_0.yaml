- en: Machine learning—the ability of a machine to give correct answers based on input
    data—has revolutionized the way we do business. Applied Supervised Learning with
    Python provides a rich understanding of how you can apply machine learning techniques
    to your data science projects using Python. You'll explore Jupyter notebooks,
    a technology that's widely used in academic and commercial circles with support
    for running inline code.

- en: With the help of fun examples, you'll gain experience working on the Python
    machine learning toolkit—from performing basic data cleaning and processing to
    working with a range of regression and classification algorithms. Once you've
    grasped the basics, you'll learn how to build and train your own models using
    advanced techniques such as decision trees, ensemble modeling, validation, and
    error metrics. You'll also learn data visualization techniques using powerful
    Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

- en: This book also covers ensemble modeling and random forest classifiers, along
    with other methods for combining results from multiple models, and concludes by
    delving into cross-validation to test your algorithm and check how well the model
    works on unseen data.

    algorithms, but also be able to create some of your own!
