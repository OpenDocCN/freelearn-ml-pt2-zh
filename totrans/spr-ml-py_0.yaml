- en: '**Supervised machine learning** is used in a wide range of sectors such as
    finance, online advertising, and analytics because it allows you to train your
    system to make pricing predictions, campaign adjustments, customer recommendations,
    and much more, giving the system the ability to self-adjust and make decisions
    on its own. The benefits this can give make it crucial to know how a machine learns
    under the hood.'

- en: This book will guide you through the implementation and nuances of many popular
    supervised machine learning algorithms. You'll embark on this journey with a quick
    overview and see how supervised machine learning differs from unsupervised learning.
    After that, we will explore parametric models such as linear and logistic regression,
    non-parametric methods such as decision trees, and various clustering techniques
    to facilitate decision-making and predictions. As we proceed, you'll work with
    recommender systems, which are widely used by online companies to increase user
    interaction and boost potential sales. Finally, we'll wrap up with a brief foray
    into neural networks and transfer learning.

    the practical know-how needed to quickly and powerfully apply supervised learning
    algorithms to new problems.

- en: '[Chapter 1](a1933cd1-a636-44f9-9729-f9e68d9c726e.xhtml), *First Step toward
    Supervised Learning*, covers the basics of supervised machine learning to get
    you prepared to start tackling problems on your own. The chapter comprises four
    important sections. First, we will get our Anaconda environment set up and make
    sure that we are able to run the examples. Over the next couple of sections following
    that, we will cover a bit more of the theory behind machine learning, before we
    start implementing algorithms in the final section, where we''ll get our Anaconda
    environment set up.'

    Models*, dives into the guts of several popular supervised learning algorithms
    within the parametric modeling family. We''ll start this section by formally introducing
    parametric models, then we''ll focus on two very popular parametric models in
    particular: linear and logistic regression. We''ll spend some time understanding
    the inner workings and then jump into Python and actually code them from scratch.'

    Models*, explores the non-parametric model family. We will start by covering the
    bias-variance trade-off, and explain how parametric and non-parametric models
    differ at a fundamental level. We will then get into decision trees and clustering
    methods. Finally, we''ll address some of the pros and cons of non-parametric models.'

    Supervised ML*, splits its time between two topics: recommender systems and neural
    networks. We''ll start with collaborative filtering and then talk about integrating
    content-based similarities into your collaborative filtering systems. Finally,
    we''ll get into neural networks and transfer learning.'
