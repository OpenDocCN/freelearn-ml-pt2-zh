			<p>Unsupervised learning is a useful and practical solution in situations where labeled data is not available. </p>
			<p><em class="italics">Applied Unsupervised Learning with Python</em> guides you through the best practices for using unsupervised learning techniques in tandem with Python libraries to extract meaningful information from unstructured data. The book begins by explaining how basic clustering works to find similar data points in a dataset. Once you are well-versed with the k-means algorithm and how it operates, you'll learn what dimensionality reduction is and where to apply it. As you progress, you'll learn various neural network techniques and how they can improve your model. While studying the applications of unsupervised learning, you will also learn how to mine topics that are trending on Twitter. You will complete the book by challenging yourself with various interesting activities, such as performing market basket analysis and identifying relationships between different products.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you will have the skills you need to confidently build your own models using Python.</p>
