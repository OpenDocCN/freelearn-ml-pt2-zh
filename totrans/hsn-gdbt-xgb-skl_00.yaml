    gradient boosting framework for scaling billions of data points quickly and efficiently.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The book introduces machine learning and XGBoost in scikit-learn before building
    up to the theory behind gradient boosting. You’ll cover decision trees and analyze
    bagging in the machine learning context, learning hyperparameters that extend
    to XGBoost along the way. You’ll build gradient boosting models from scratch and
    extend gradient boosting to big data while recognizing speed limitations using
    timers. Details in XGBoost are explored with a focus on speed enhancements and
    deriving parameters mathematically. With the help of detailed case studies, you’ll
    practice building and fine-tuning XGBoost classifiers and regressors using scikit-learn
    and the original Python API. You'll leverage XGBoost hyperparameters to improve
    scores, correct missing values, scale imbalanced datasets, and fine-tune alternative
    base learners. Finally, you'll apply advanced XGBoost techniques like building
    non-correlated ensembles, stacking models, and preparing models for industry deployment
    using sparse matrices, customized transformers, and pipelines.

    models using XGBoost with minimal errors and maximum speed.
