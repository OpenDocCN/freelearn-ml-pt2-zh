    over the years, mainly due to their explosion in price levels, as well as the
    business opportunities that blockchain technologies offer. In this chapter, we
    will attempt to predict the next day's Bitcoin (BTC) price using historical data.
    There are many sources that offer cryptocurrency's historical price data. We will
    use Yahoo finance data, available at [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/history/).
    In this chapter, we will focus on predicting future prices and leveraging that
    knowledge to invest in bitcoin.

- en: Time series data is concerned with data instances in which each instance relates
    to a specific point in time or interval. How often we measure the variable of
    choice defines the time series' sampling frequency. For example, atmospheric temperature
    differs throughout the day and throughout the year. We can choose to measure the
    temperature every hour, so we have an hourly frequency, or we can choose to measure
    it each day, so we have a daily frequency. In finance, it is not unusual to have
    frequencies that are between major time intervals; this could be every 10 minutes
    (10m frequency) or every 4 hours (4h frequency). Another interesting characteristic
    of time series is that there is usually a correlation between instances that refer
    to proximal time points.

    cannot vary by a great magnitude between consecutive minutes. Furthermore, this
    enables us to utilize earlier data points to predict future data points. An example
    of temperatures (an average of 3 hours) for Athens and Greece for the years 2016–2019
    is provided in figure. Notice how most temperatures are relatively close to the
    previous day''s temperature, even though there are variations. Furthermore, we
    see a repeating pattern of hot and cold months (seasons), which is called seasonality:'

    a month''s temperature cannot deviate much from the previous month, which is logical.
    For example, December and January are cold months, and usually, their average
    temperatures are closer than December and March, for example. Furthermore, there
    is a strong negative correlation between lags 5 and 6, indicating that a cold

    or less the same value for the same month of each year. This indicates that the
    distribution of temperatures does not change over time. Time series that exhibit
    this behavior are called **stationary**. This allows for relatively easy modeling
    with time series analysis tools, such as **auto regressive** (**AR**), **moving
    average** (**MA**), and **auto regressive integrated moving average** (**ARIMA**)
    models. Financial data is usually non-stationary, as seen in the daily Bitcoin
    close data, depicted in figure. This means that the data does not exhibit the
    same behavior throughout its entire history, but instead its behavior varies.

    in [Chapter 5](a0e9eea5-bc95-4d15-9679-fafce5718525.xhtml), *Bagging*. To implement
    it in our experiment, we simply call it using `lr = BaggingRegressor()` instead
    of the previous regressors. This results in an MSE of 19.45 and a Sharpe of 0.09\.

    model. First, we can experiment with shallow trees, which will further reduce
    variance in the ensemble. By utilizing trees with a maximum depth of `3`, using
    `lr = BaggingRegressor(base_estimator=DecisionTreeRegressor(max_depth=3))`, we
    can improve the model's performance, generating an MSE of 17.59 and a Sharpe value
    of 0.15\. Further restricting the trees' growth to `max_depth=1`, allows the model
    to achieve an MSE of 16.7 and a Sharpe value of 0.27\. If we examine the model's
    trading plots, we observe a reduction in the number of trades, as well as a considerable
    improvement in performance during periods in which Bitcoin's price significantly
    drops. This indicates that the model can filter noise from actual signals more
    efficiently.

    complicated models to be generated. In this section, we will utilize XGBoost to
    model our time series data. As there are many degrees of freedom (hyperparameters)
    when modeling with XGBoost, we expect some level of fine-tuning to be needed to
    achieve satisfactory results. By replacing our example's regressor with `lr =
    XGBRegressor()`, we can utilize XGBoost and fit it onto our data. This results
    in an MSE of 19.20 and a Sharpe value of 0.13.

    bought and sold, we can assume it is overfitting the training data. Therefore,
    we'll will try to regularize its learning. The first step is to limit the maximum
    depth of individual trees. We start by imposing an upper limit of 2, using `max_depth=2`.
    This slightly improves our model, yielding an MSE of 19.14 and a Sharpe value
    of 0.17\. Further limiting the overfitting capabilities of the model by using
    only 10 base learners (`n_estimators=10`), the model achieves additional improvement.

    the rolling average, we will start with only 20 lags and the return percentages

    ensemble methods presented in earlier chapters of this book. As with most datasets,
    there are many decisions that affect a model's quality. Data preprocessing and
    feature engineering are some of the most important factors, especially when the
    dataset's nature does not allow direct modeling of the data. Time series datasets
    fall into this category, in which the construction of appropriate features and
    targets is required. By transforming our non-stationary time series to stationary,
    we improved the algorithm's ability to model the data.

    as well as the Sharpe ratio (in which we assumed that the model was utilized as
    a trading strategy). When MSE is concerned, the best performing ensemble proved
    to be the simple voting ensemble. The ensemble consisted of an SVM and KNN regressor,
    without any hyperparameter fine-tuning, achieving an MSE of 15.71\. As a trading
    strategy, XGBoost proved to be the best ensemble, achieving a Sharpe value of
    0.32\. Although not exhaustive, this chapter has explored the possibilities and
    techniques used in time series modeling using ensemble learning methods.
