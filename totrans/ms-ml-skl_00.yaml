- en: Recent years have seen the rise of machine learning, the study of software that
    learns from experience. While machine learning is a new discipline, it has found
    many applications. We rely on some of these applications daily; in some cases,
    their successes have already rendered them mundane. Many other applications have
    only recently been conceived, and hint at machine learning's potential.

- en: In this book, we will examine several machine learning models and learning algorithms.
    We will discuss tasks that machine learning is commonly applied to, and learn
    to measure the performance of machine learning systems. We will work with a popular
    library for the Python programming language called scikit-learn, which has assembled
    excellent implementations of many machine learning models and algorithms under
    a simple yet versatile API.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. The Fundamentals of Machine Learning"), *The
    Fundamentals of Machine Learning*, defines machine learning as the study and design
    of programs that improve their performance of a task by learning from experience.
    This definition guides the other chapters; in each chapter, we will examine a
    machine learning model, apply it to a task, and measure its performance.'

    discusses linear regression, a model that relates explanatory variables and model
    parameters to a continuous response variable. You will learn about cost functions,
    and use the normal equation to find the parameter values that produce the optimal
    model.'

    Extraction and Preprocessing*, describes methods to represent text, images, and
    categorical variables as features that can be used in machine learning models.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression"),
    *From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression*, discusses generalizing linear
    regression to support classification tasks. We combine a model called logistic
    regression with some of the feature engineering techniques from the previous chapter
    to create a spam filter.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Nonlinear Classification and Regression with
    Decision Trees"), *Nonlinear Classification and Regression with Decision Trees*,
    departs from linear models to discuss classification and regression with models
    called decision trees. We use an ensemble of decision trees to construct a banner
    advertisement blocker.'

    K-Means*, introduces unsupervised learning. We examine the k-means algorithm,
    and combine it with logistic regression to create a semi-supervised photo classifier.'

    Reduction with PCA*, discusses another unsupervised learning task called dimensionality
    reduction. We use principal component analysis to visualize high-dimensional data
    and build a face recognizer.'

    an online, binary classifier called the perceptron. The limitations of the perceptron
    motivate the models described in the final chapters.'

    machines to recognize the characters in photographs of street signs.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is intended for software developers who have some experience with
    machine learning. scikit-learn's API is well-documented, but assumes that the
    reader understands how machine learning algorithms work and when it is appropriate
    to use them. This book does not attempt to reproduce the API's documentation.
    Instead, it describes how machine learning models work, how their parameters are
    learned, and how they can be evaluated. When practical, we will work through toy
    examples of the algorithms in detail to build the understanding required to apply
    them effectively.
