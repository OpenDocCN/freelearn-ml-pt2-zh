- en: Ensembling is a technique for combining two or more similar or dissimilar machine
    learning algorithms to create a model that delivers superior predictive power.
    This book will demonstrate how you can use a variety of weak algorithms to make
    a strong predictive model.

- en: With its hands-on approach, you'll not only get up to speed on the basic theory,
    but also the application of various ensemble learning techniques. Using examples
    and real-world datasets, you'll be able to produce better machine learning models
    to solve supervised learning problems such as classification and regression. Later
    in the book, you'll go on to leverage ensemble learning techniques such as clustering
    to produce unsupervised machine learning models. As you progress, the chapters
    will cover different machine learning algorithms that are widely used in the practical
    world to make predictions and classifications. You'll even get to grips with using
    Python libraries such as scikit-learn and Keras to implement different ensemble
    models.

    the skills you need to understand which ensemble method is required for which
    problem, in order to successfully implement them in real-world scenarios.

- en: This book is aimed at analysts, data scientists, engineers, and other professionals
    who have an interest in generating advanced models that describe and generalize
    datasets of interest to them. It is assumed that the reader has basic experience
    of programming in Python and is familiar with elementary machine learning models.
    Furthermore, a basic understanding of statistics is assumed, although key points
    and more advanced concepts are briefly presented. Familiarity with Python's scikit-learn module
    would be greatly beneficial, although it is not strictly required. A standard
    Python installation is required. Anaconda Distribution ([https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/))
    greatly simplifies the task of installing and managing the various Python packages,
    although it is not necessary. Finally, a good **Integrated Development Environment**
    (**IDE**) is extremely useful for managing your code and debugging. In our examples,
    we usually utilize the Spyder IDE, which can be easily installed through Anaconda.
