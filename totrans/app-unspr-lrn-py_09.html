			<p>Let's consider an imaginary scenario: a new disease has begun spreading through numerous communities in the country that you live in and the government is trying to figure out how to confront this health emergency. Critical to any plan to confront this health emergency is epidemiological knowledge, including where the patients are located and how the disease is moving. The ability to locate and quantify problem areas (which are classically referred to as hotspots) can help health professionals, policy makers, and emergency response teams craft the most effective and efficient strategies for combating the disease. This scenario highlights one of the many applications of hotspot modeling.</p>
			<p>Hotspot modeling is an approach that is used to identify how a population is distributed across a geographical area; for example, how the population of individuals infected with the previously mentioned disease is spread across the country. The creation of this distribution relies on the availability of representative sample data. Note that the population can be anything definable in geographical terms, which includes, but is not limited to, crime, disease-infected individuals, people with certain demographic characteristics, or hurricanes:</p>

			<p>Hotspot analysis is incredibly popular, and this is mainly because of how easy it is to visualize the results and to read and interpret the visualizations. Newspapers, websites, blogs, and TV shows all leverage hotspot analysis to support the arguments, chapters, and topics included in them or on them. While it might not be as well-known as the most popular machine learning models, the main hotspot analysis algorithm, known as <strong class="keyword">kernel density estimation</strong>, is arguably one of the most widely used analytical techniques. Kernel density estimation is a hotspot analysis technique that is used to estimate the true population distribution of specific geographical events.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-197"><a id="_idTextAnchor220"/>Spatial Statistics</h3>
			<p><strong class="keyword">Spatial statistics</strong> is a branch of statistics that focuses on the analysis of data that has spatial properties, including geographic or topological coordinates. It is similar to time series analysis in that the goal is to analyze data that changes across some dimension. In the case of time series analysis, the dimension across which the data changes is time, whereas in the spatial statistics case, the data changes across the spatial dimension. There are a number of techniques that are included under the spatial statistics umbrella, but the technique we are concerned with here is kernel density estimation.</p>
			<p>As is the goal of most statistical analyses, in spatial statistics, we are trying to take samples of geographic data and use them to generate insights and make predictions. The analysis of earthquakes is one arena in which spatial statistical analyses are commonly deployed. By collecting earthquake location data, maps that identify areas of high and low earthquake likelihood can be generated, which can help scientists determine both where future earthquakes are likely to occur and what to expect in terms of intensity.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-198"><a id="_idTextAnchor221"/>Probability Density Functions</h3>
			<p>Kernel density estimation uses the idea of the <strong class="keyword">probability density function</strong> (<strong class="keyword">PDF</strong>), which is one of the foundational concepts in statistics. The probability density function is a function that describes the behavior of a continuous <strong class="keyword">random variable</strong>. That is, it expresses the likelihood, or probability, that the random variable takes on some range of values. Consider the heights of males in the United States as an example. By using the probability density function of the heights of males in the United States, we can determine the probability that some United States-based male is between 1.9 and 1.95 meters tall:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 9.2: The standard normal distribution</h6>
			<p>Possibly the most popular density function in statistics is the standard normal distribution, which is simply the normal distribution centered at zero with the standard deviation equal to one. </p>
			<p>Instead of the density function, what is typically available to statisticians or data scientists are randomly collected sample values coming from a population distribution that is unknown. This is where kernel density estimation comes in; it is a technique that is used for estimating the unknown probability density function of a random variable using sample data:</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-199"><a id="_idTextAnchor222"/>Using Hotspot Analysis in Business</h3>
			<p>We have already mentioned some of the ways in which hotspot modeling can be leveraged to meaningfully impact industry. The following use cases are common applications of hotspot modeling.</p>
			<p>When reporting on infectious diseases, health organizations and media companies typically use hotspot analysis to communicate where the diseases are located and the likelihood of contracting the disease based on geographic location. Using hotspot analysis, this information could be reliably computed and disseminated. Hotspot analysis is great for dealing with health data because the visualizations are very straightforward. This means that the chances of data being misinterpreted either intentionally or unintentionally are relatively low.</p>
			<p>Hotspot analysis can also be used to predict where certain events are likely to occur geographically. One research area that is leveraging the predictive capabilities of hotspot analysis more and more is the environmental sciences, which includes the study of natural disasters and extreme weather events. Earthquakes, for example, are notorious for being difficult to predict, because the time between significant earthquakes can be large, and the machinery needed to track and measure earthquakes to the degree required to make these predictions is relatively new.</p>
			<p>In terms of public policy and resource deployment, hotspot analysis can be very impactful when dealing with the analysis of population demographics. Determining where resources, both monetary and personnel, should be deployed can be challenging; however, given that resources are often demographic-specific, hotspot analysis is a useful technique since it can be used to determine the distribution of certain demographic characteristics. By demographic characteristics we mean that we could find the geographic distribution of high school graduates, immigrants from a specific global region, or individuals making $100,000 or more annually.</p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-200"><a id="_idTextAnchor223"/>Kernel Density Estimation</h2>
			<p>One of the main methodological approaches to hotspot analysis is kernel density estimation. Kernel density estimation builds an estimated density using sample data and two parameters known as the <strong class="keyword">kernel function</strong> and the <strong class="keyword">bandwidth value</strong>. The estimated density is, like any distribution, essentially a guideline for the behavior of a random variable. Here, we mean how frequently the random variable takes on any specific value, <img alt="" src="image/C12626_09_Formula_01.png"/>. When dealing with hotspot analysis where the data is typically geographic, the estimated density answers the question <em class="italics">How frequently do specific longitude and latitude pairs appear?</em>. If a specific longitude and latitude pair, <img alt="" src="image/C12626_09_Formula_02.png"/>, and other nearby pairs occur with high frequency, then the estimated density built using the sample data will be expected to show that the area around the longitude and latitude pair has a high likelihood.</p>
			<p>Kernel density estimation is referred to as a smoothing algorithm, because the process of estimating a density is the process of estimating the underlying shape of the data by disregarding the eccentricities and anomalies in the sample data. Stated another way, kernel density estimation removes the noise from the data. The only assumption of the model is that the data truly belongs to some interpretable and meaningful density from which insights can be derived and acted upon. That is, there exists a true underlying distribution.</p>
			<p>Arguably, more than any other topic in this book, kernel density estimation embodies the basic idea of statistics, which is to use sample data of finite size to make inferences about the population. We assume that the sample data contains clusters of data points and that these clusters imply regions of high likelihood in the true population. A benefit of creating a quality estimate of the true population density is that the estimated density can then be used to sample more data from the population.</p>
			<p>Following this brief introduction, you probably have the following two questions:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the bandwidth value?</li>
				<li>What is the kernel function?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>We answer both of these questions next.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-201"><a id="_idTextAnchor224"/>The Bandwidth Value</h3>
			<p>The most crucial parameter in kernel density estimation is called the <strong class="keyword">bandwidth value</strong> and its impact on the quality of the estimate cannot be overestimated. A high-level definition of the bandwidth value is that it is a value that determines the degree of smoothing. If the bandwidth value is low, then the estimated density will feature limited smoothing, which means that the density will capture all the noise in the sample data. If the bandwidth value is high, then the estimated density will be very smooth. An overly smooth density will remove characteristics of the true density from the estimated density, which are legitimate and not simply noise.</p>
			<p>In more statistical or machine learning languages, the bandwidth parameter controls the bias-variance trade-off. That is, high variance is the result of low bandwidth values because the density is sensitive to the variance of the sample data. Low bandwidth values limit any ability the model may have had to adapt to and work around gaps in the sample data that are not present in the population. Densities estimated using low bandwidth values tend to overfit the data (this is also known as under-smoothed densities). When high bandwidth values are used, then the resulting density is underfit and the estimated density has a high bias (this is also known as over-smoothed densities).</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-202"><a id="_idTextAnchor225"/>Exercise 46: The Effect of the Bandwidth Value</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will fit nine different models with nine different bandwidth values to sample data created in the exercise. The goal here is to solidify our understanding of the impact the bandwidth parameter can have and make clear that if an accurate estimated density is sought, then the bandwidth value needs to be selected with care. Note that finding an optimal bandwidth value will be the topic of the next section. All exercises will be done in a Jupyter notebook utilizing Python 3; ensure that all package installation is done using <strong class="inline">pip</strong>. The easiest way to install the <strong class="inline">basemap</strong> module from <strong class="inline">mpl_toolkits</strong> is by using <em class="italics">Anaconda</em>. Instructions for downloading and installing <em class="italics">Anaconda</em> can be found at the beginning of this book:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Load all of the libraries that are needed for the exercises in this chapter. Here, the <strong class="inline">matplotlib</strong> library is used to create basic graphics; the <strong class="inline">basemap</strong> library is used to create graphics involving location data; the <strong class="inline">numpy</strong> library is used for working with arrays and matrices; the <strong class="inline">pandas</strong> library is used for working with DataFrames; the <strong class="inline">scipy</strong> library is used for scientific computing in Python; the <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> library is used for creating much more attractive and complicated graphics; and the <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> library is used to access data, manipulate the data, and run models. Additionally, ensure that the graphics be run inline and set to <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong>, so that all graphics appear as <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> graphics:<p class="snippet">get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')</p><p class="snippet">import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</p><p class="snippet">import mpl_toolkits.basemap</p><p class="snippet">import numpy</p><p class="snippet">import pandas</p><p class="snippet">import scipy.stats</p><p class="snippet">import seaborn</p><p class="snippet">import sklearn.datasets</p><p class="snippet">import sklearn.model_selection</p><p class="snippet">import sklearn.neighbors</p><p class="snippet">seaborn.set()</p></li>
				<li>Create some sample data (<strong class="inline">vals</strong>) by mixing three normal distributions. In addition to the sample data, define the true density curve (<strong class="inline">true_density</strong>) and the range over which the data will be plotted (<strong class="inline">x_vec</strong>):<p class="snippet">x_vec = numpy.linspace(-30, 30, 10000)[:, numpy.newaxis]</p><p class="snippet">vals = numpy.concatenate((</p><p class="snippet">    numpy.random.normal(loc=1, scale=2.5, size=500), </p><p class="snippet">    numpy.random.normal(loc=10, scale=4, size=500), </p><p class="snippet">    numpy.random.normal(loc=-12, scale=5, size=500)</p><p class="snippet">))[:, numpy.newaxis]</p><p class="snippet">true_density = (</p><p class="snippet">    (1 / 3) * scipy.stats.norm(1, 2.5).pdf(x_vec[:, 0]) + </p><p class="snippet">    (1 / 3) * scipy.stats.norm(10, 4).pdf(x_vec[:, 0]) +</p><p class="snippet">    (1 / 3) * scipy.stats.norm(-12, 5).pdf(x_vec[:, 0])</p><p class="snippet">)</p></li>
				<li>Define a list of tuples that will guide the creation of the multiplot graphic. Each tuple contains the row and column indices of the specific subplot, and the bandwidth value used to create the estimated density in that particular subplot:<p class="snippet">position_bandwidth_vec = [</p><p class="snippet">    (0, 0, 0.1), (0, 1, 0.4), (0, 2, 0.7), </p><p class="snippet">    (1, 0, 1.0), (1, 1, 1.3), (1, 2, 1.6), </p><p class="snippet">    (2, 0, 1.9), (2, 1, 2.5), (2, 2, 5.0)</p><p class="snippet">]</p></li>
				<li>Create nine plots each using a different bandwidth value. The first plot, with the index of (0, 0), will have the lowest bandwidth and the last plot, with the index of (2, 2), will have the highest bandwidth. These values are not the absolute lowest or absolute highest bandwidth values, rather they are only the minimum and maximum of the list defined in the previous step:<p class="snippet">fig, ax = plt.subplots(3, 3, sharex=True, sharey=True, figsize=(12, 9))</p><p class="snippet">fig.suptitle('The Effect of the Bandwidth Value', fontsize=16)</p><p class="snippet">for r, c, b in position_bandwidth_vec:</p><p class="snippet">    kde = sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity(bandwidth=b).fit(vals)</p><p class="snippet">    log_density = kde.score_samples(x_vec)</p><p class="snippet">    ax[r, c].hist(vals, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.5)</p><p class="snippet">    ax[r, c].plot(x_vec[:, 0], numpy.exp(log_density), '-', linewidth=2)</p><p class="snippet">    ax[r, c].set_title('Bandwidth = {}'.format(b))</p><p>The output is as follows:</p></li>

			</div>
			<h6>Figure 9.4: A 3 x 3 matrix of subplots; each of which features an estimated density created using one of nine bandwidth values</h6>
			<p>Notice that on the lower end, the density curves clearly overfit the data. As the bandwidth values increase, the estimated density becomes smoother until it noticeably underfits the data. Visually, it looks like the optimal bandwidth may be around 1.6.</p>
			<p>The next step is to design an algorithm to identify the optimal bandwidth value, so that the estimated density is the most reasonable and, therefore, the most reliable and actionable.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-203"><a id="_idTextAnchor226"/>Selecting the Optimal Bandwidth</h3>
			<p>As mentioned in the previous exercise, we can come quite close to selecting the optimal bandwidth by simply comparing several densities visually. However, this is neither the most efficient method of selecting parameter values nor the most reliable. </p>
			<p>There are two standard approaches to optimizing the bandwidth value, and both of these will appear in future exercises and activities. The first approach is a plug-in method (or a formulaic approach) that is deterministic and not optimized on the sample data. Plug-in methods are generally much faster to implement, simpler to code, and easier to explain. However, these methods have one big downside, which is that their accuracy tends to suffer compared to approaches that are optimized on the sample data. These methods also have distributional assumptions. The most popular plug-in methods are Silverman's Rule and Scott's Rule. By default, the <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> package (which will be used in future exercises) uses Scott's Rule as the method to determine the bandwidth value. </p>
			<p>The second, and arguably the more robust, approach to finding an optimal bandwidth value is by searching a predefined grid of bandwidth values. Grid search is an empirical approach that is used frequently in machine learning and predictive modeling to optimize model hyperparameters. The process starts by defining the bandwidth grid, which is simply the collection of bandwidth values to be evaluated. Use each bandwidth value in the grid to create an estimated density; then, score the estimated density using the pseudo-log-likelihood value. The optimal bandwidth value is that which has the maximum pseudo-log-likelihood value. Think of the pseudo-log-likelihood value as the result of the probability of getting data points where we did get data points and the probability of not getting points where we did not get any data points. Ideally, both of these probabilities would be large. Consider the case where the probability of getting data points where we did get points is low. In this situation, the implication would be that the data points in the sample were anomalous because, under the true distribution, getting points where we did would not be expected with a high likelihood value.</p>
			<p>Let's now implement the grid search approach to optimize the bandwidth value.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-204"><a id="_idTextAnchor227"/>Exercise 47: Selecting the Optimal Bandwidth Using Grid Search</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will create an estimated density for the sample data created in <em class="italics">Exercise 46</em>, <em class="italics">The Effect of the Bandwidth Value</em> with an optimal bandwidth value identified using grid search and cross-validation. To run the grid search with cross-validation, we will leverage <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong>, which we have used throughout this book. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1 as we are using the same sample data and continuing our exploration of the bandwidth value:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define a grid of bandwidth values and the grid search cross-validation model. Ideally, the leave-one-out approach to cross-validation should be used, but for the sake of having the model run in a reasonable amount of time, we will do a 10-fold cross-validation. Fit the model on the sample data, as follows:<p class="snippet">bandwidths = 10 ** numpy.linspace(-1, 1, 100)</p><p class="snippet">grid = sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV(</p><p class="snippet">    estimator=sklearn.neighbors.KernelDensity(kernel="gaussian"),</p><p class="snippet">    param_grid={"bandwidth": bandwidths},</p><p class="snippet">    cv=10 #sklearn.model_selection.LeaveOneOut().get_n_splits(vals)</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p class="snippet">grid.fit(vals)</p></li>
				<li>Extract the optimal bandwidth value from the model, as follows:<p class="snippet">best_bandwidth = grid.best_params_["bandwidth"]</p><p class="snippet">print(</p><p class="snippet">    "Best Bandwidth Value: {}"</p><p class="snippet">    .format(best_bandwidth)</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p>The optimal bandwidth value should be approximately two. We can interpret the optimal bandwidth value as the bandwidth value producing the maximum pseudo-log-likelihood value. Note that depending on the values included in the grid, the optimal bandwidth value can change.</p></li>
				<li>Plot the histogram of the sample data overlaid by both the true and estimated densities. In this case, the estimated density will be the optimal estimated density:<p class="snippet">fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(14, 10))</p><p class="snippet">ax.hist(vals, bins=50, density=True, alpha=0.5, label='Sampled Values')</p><p class="snippet">ax.fill(</p><p class="snippet">      x_vec[:, 0], true_density,</p><p class="snippet">      fc='black', alpha=0.3, label='True Distribution'</p><p class="snippet">      )</p><p class="snippet">log_density = numpy.exp(grid.best_estimator_.score_samples(x_vec))</p><p class="snippet">ax.plot(</p><p class="snippet">        x_vec[:, 0], log_density,</p><p class="snippet">        '-', linewidth=2, label='Kernel = Gaussian'</p><p class="snippet">        )</p><p class="snippet">ax.legend(loc='upper right')</p><p>The output is as follows:</p></li>

			</div>
			<h6>Figure 9.5: A histogram of the random sample with the true density and the optimal estimated density overlaid</h6>
			<p>The estimated density is neither overfit or underfit to any noticeable degree and it definitely captures the three clusters. Arguably, it could map to the true density better, but this is just an estimated density generated by a model that has limitations.</p>
			<p>Let's now move onto the second question: what is the kernel function and what role does it play?</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-205"><a id="_idTextAnchor228"/>Kernel Functions</h3>
			<p>The other parameter to be set is the kernel function. The kernel is a non-negative function that controls the shape of the density. Like topic models, we are working in a non-negative environment because it does not make sense to have negative likelihoods or probabilities. </p>
			<p>The kernel function controls the shape of the estimated density by weighting the points in a systematic way. This systematic methodology for weighting is fairly simple; data points that are in close proximity to many other data points are up-weighted, whereas data points that are alone or far away from any other data points are down-weighted. Up-weighted data points will correspond to points of higher likelihood in the final estimated density.</p>
			<p>Many functions can be used as kernels, but six frequent choices are Gaussian, Tophat, Epanechnikov, Exponential, Linear, and Cosine. Each of these functions represents a unique distributional shape. Note that in each of the formulas the parameter, <em class="italics">h</em>, represents the bandwidth value:</p>

			<p>The choice of kernel function is not completely insignificant, but it is definitely not nearly as important as the choice of bandwidth value. A reasonable book of action would be to use the gaussian kernel for all density estimation problems, which is what we will do in the following exercises and activities.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-206"><a id="_idTextAnchor229"/>Exercise 48: The Effect of the Kernel Function</h3>
			<p>The goal of this exercise is to understand how the choice of kernel function affects the quality of the density estimation. Like we did when exploring the bandwidth value effect, we will hold all other parameters constant, use the same data generated in the first two exercises, and run six different kernel density estimation models using the six kernel functions previously specified. Clear differences should be noticeable between the six estimated densities, but these differences should be slightly less dramatic than the differences between the densities estimated using the different bandwidth values:</p>

			<h6>Figure 9.13: A 3 x 2 matrix of subplots, each of which features an estimated density created using one of six kernel functions</h6>
			<p>Out of the six kernel functions, the gaussian kernel produced the most reasonable estimated density. Beyond that, notice that the difference between the estimated densities with different kernels is less than the difference between the estimated densities with different bandwidth values. This goes to the previously made claim that the bandwidth value is the more important parameter and should be the focus during the model building process.</p>
			<p>With our understanding mostly formed, let's discuss the derivation of kernel density estimation in a high-level fashion.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-207"><a id="_idTextAnchor230"/>Kernel Density Estimation Derivation</h3>
			<p>Let's skip the formal mathematical derivation in favor of the popular derivation by intuition. Kernel density estimation turns each data point in the sample into its own distribution whose width is controlled by the bandwidth value. The individual distributions are then summed to create the desired density estimate. This concept is fairly easy to demonstrate; however, before doing that in the next exercise, let's try to think through it in an abstract way. For geographic regions containing many sample data points, the individual densities will overlap and, through the process of summing those densities, will create points of high likelihood in the estimated density. Similarly, for geographic regions containing few to no sample data points, the individual densities will not overlap and, therefore, will correspond to points of low likelihood in the estimated density.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-208"><a id="_idTextAnchor231"/>Exercise 49: Simulating the Derivation of Kernel Density Estimation</h3>
			<p>The goal here is to demonstrate the concept of summing individual distributions to create an overall estimated density for a random variable. We will establish the concept incrementally by starting with one sample data point and then work up to many sample data points. Additionally, different bandwidth values will be applied, so our understanding of the effect of the bandwidth value on these individual densities will solidify further:</p>

			<p>Again, unsurprisingly, the plot utilizing the smallest bandwidth value features a wildly overfitted estimated density. That is, the estimated density captures all the noise in the sample data. Of these three densities, the second one, where the bandwidth value was set to 0.35, is the most reasonable.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-209"><a id="_idTextAnchor232"/>Activity 21: Estimating Density in One Dimension</h3>
			<p>In this first activity, we will be generating some fake sample data and estimating the density function using kernel density estimation. The bandwidth value will be optimized using grid search cross-validation. The goal is to solidify our understanding of this useful methodology by running the model in a simple one-dimension case. We will once again leverage Jupyter notebooks to do our work.</p>
			<p>Imagine that the sample data we will be creating describes the price of homes in a state in the United States. Momentarily ignore the values in the following sample data. The question is, <em class="italics">What does the distribution of home prices look like, and can we extract the probability of a house having a price that falls in some specific range?</em> These questions and more are answerable using kernel density estimation.</p>
			<p>Here are the steps to complete the activity:</p>

				<li value="1">Open a new notebook and install all the necessary libraries.</li>
				<li>Sample 1,000 data points from the standard normal distribution. Add 3.5 to each of the last 625 values of the sample (that is, the indices between 375 and 1,000). Set a random state of 100.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-210"><a id="_idTextAnchor233"/>Hotspot Analysis</h2>
			<p>To start, hotspots are areas of higher concentrations of data points, such as particular neighborhoods where the crime rate is abnormally high or swaths of the country that are impacted by an above-average number of tornadoes. Hotspot analysis is the process of finding these hotspots, should any exist, in a population using sampled data. This process is generally done by leveraging kernel density estimation.</p>
			<p>Hotspot analysis can be described in four high-level steps: </p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1"><strong class="keyword">Collect the data</strong>: The data should include the locations of the objects or events. As we have briefly mentioned, the amount of data needed to run and achieve actionable results is relatively flexible. The optimal state is to have a sample dataset that is representative of the population.</li>
				<li><strong class="keyword">Identify the base map</strong>: The next step is to identify which base map would best suit the analytical and presentational needs of the project. On this base map, the results of the model will be overlaid, so that the locations of the hotspots can be easily articulated in much more digestible terms, such as city, neighborhood, or region. </li>
				<li><strong class="keyword">Execute the model</strong>: In this step, you select and execute one or multiple methodologies of extracting spatial patterns to identify hotspots. For us, this method will be – no surprise – kernel density estimation. </li>
				<li><strong class="keyword">Create the visualization</strong>: The hotspot maps are generated by overlaying the model results on the base map to support whatever business questions are outstanding.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>One of the principal issues with hotspot analysis from a usability standpoint is that the statistical significance of a hotspot is not particularly easy to ascertain. Most questions about statistical significance revolve around the existence of the hotspots. That is, do the fluctuations in likelihood of occurrence actually amount to statistically significant fluctuations? It is important to note that statistical significance is not required to perform kernel density estimation and that we will not be dealing with significance at all going forward.</p>
			<p>While the term hotspot is traditionally reserved to describe a cluster of location data points, it is not limited to location data. Any data type can have hotspots regardless of whether or not they are referred to as hotspots. In one of the following exercises, we will model some non-location data to find hotspots, which will be regions of feature space having a high or low likelihood of occurrence.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-211"><a id="_idTextAnchor234"/>Exercise 50: Loading Data and Modeling with Seaborn</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will work with the <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> library to fit and visualize kernel density estimation models. This is done on both location and non-location data. Before getting into the modeling, we load the data, which is the California housing dataset that is automatically loaded with <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong>. Taken from the United States census in 1990, this dataset describes the housing situation in California during that time. One row of data describes one census block group. The definition of a census block group is irrelevant to this exercise, so we will bypass the definition here in favor of more hands-on coding and modeling. It is important to mention that all the variables are aggregated to the census block. For example, <strong class="inline">MedInc</strong> is the median income of households in each census block. Additional information on this dataset is available at <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#california-housing-dataset"><span class="Hyperlink">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/datasets/index.html#california-housing-dataset</span></a>:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Load the California housing dataset using <strong class="inline">fetch_california_housing()</strong>. Convert the data to a DataFrame using <strong class="inline">pandas</strong> and print the first five rows of the DataFrame:<p class="snippet">housing = sklearn.datasets.fetch_california_housing()</p><p class="snippet">df = pandas.DataFrame(housing['data'], columns=housing['feature_names'])</p><p class="snippet">print("Dataframe Dimensions: {dims}".format(dims=df.shape))</p><p class="snippet">df.head()</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer384"><img alt="Figure 9.17: The first five rows of the California housing dataset from sklearn&#13; &#10;" src="image/C12626_09_17.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.17: The first five rows of the California housing dataset from sklearn</h6></li>
				<li>Filter the DataFrame based on the <strong class="inline">HouseAge</strong> feature, which is the median home age of each census block. Keep only the rows with <strong class="inline">HouseAge</strong> less than or equal to 15 and name the DataFrame <strong class="inline">dfLess15</strong>. Print out the first five rows of the DataFrame; Then, reduce the DataFrame down to just the longitude and latitude features:<p class="snippet">dfLess15 = df[df['HouseAge'] &lt;= 15.0]</p><p class="snippet">dfLess15 = dfLess15[['Latitude', 'Longitude']]</p><p class="snippet">print(</p><p class="snippet">    "Less Than Or Equal To 15 Years Dataframe Dimensions: {dims}"</p><p class="snippet">    .format(dims=dfLess15.shape)</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p class="snippet">dfLess15.head()</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer385"><img alt="Figure 9.18: The first five rows of the dataset filtered down to those rows that have a value of 15 or less in the HouseAge column &#13;&#10;" src="image/C12626_09_18.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.18: The first five rows of the dataset filtered down to those rows that have a value of 15 or less in the HouseAge column</h6></li>
				<li>Use <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> to fit and visualize the kernel density estimation model built on the longitude and latitude data points. The <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> approach to fitting these models uses Scott's Rule. There are four inputs to the model, which are the names of the two columns over which the estimated density is sought (that is, the longitude and latitude), the DataFrame to which those columns belong, and the method of density estimation (that is, the <strong class="inline">kde</strong> or kernel density estimation):<p class="snippet">seaborn.jointplot("Longitude", "Latitude", dfLess15, kind="kde")</p><p> The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer386"><img alt="Figure 9.19: A joint plot containing both the two-dimensional estimated density plus the marginal densities for the dfLess15 dataset&#13;&#10;" src="image/C12626_09_19.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.19: A joint plot containing both the two-dimensional estimated density plus the marginal densities for the dfLess15 dataset</h6><p>If we overlay these results on a map of California, we will see that the hotspots are southern California, including Los Angeles and San Diego, the bay area, including San Francisco, and to a small degree the area known as the central valley. A benefit of this <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> graphic is that we get the two-dimensional estimated density and the marginal densities for both longitude and latitude.</p></li>
				<li>Create another filtered DataFrame based on the <strong class="inline">HouseAge</strong> feature; this time keep only the rows with <strong class="inline">HouseAge</strong> greater than 40 and name the DataFrame <strong class="inline">dfMore40</strong>. Additionally, remove all the columns except for longitude and latitude. Then, print the first five rows of the DataFrame:<p class="snippet">dfMore40 = df[df['HouseAge'] &gt; 40.0]</p><p class="snippet">dfMore40 = dfMore40[['Latitude', 'Longitude']]</p><p class="snippet">print(</p><p class="snippet">    "More Than 40 Years Dataframe Dimensions: {dims}"</p><p class="snippet">    .format(dims=dfMore40.shape)</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p class="snippet">dfMore40.head()</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer387"><img alt="Figure 9.20: The top of the dataset filtered to the rows containing values greater than 40 in the HouseAge column&#13;&#10;" src="image/C12626_09_20.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.20: The top of the dataset filtered to the rows containing values greater than 40 in the HouseAge column</h6></li>
				<li>Repeat the process from <em class="italics">Step 3</em>, but now using this new filtered DataFrame:<p class="snippet">seaborn.jointplot("Longitude", "Latitude", dfMore40, kind="kde")</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer388"><img alt="Figure 9.21: A joint plot containing both the two-dimensional estimated density plus the marginal densities for the dfMore40 dataset&#13;&#10;" src="image/C12626_09_21.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.21: A joint plot containing both the two-dimensional estimated density plus the marginal densities for the dfMore40 dataset</h6><p>This estimated density is much more compact in that the data is clustered almost entirely in two areas. Those areas are Los Angeles and the bay area. Comparing this to the plot in <em class="italics">Step 3</em>, we notice that housing development has spread out across the state. Additionally, newer housing developments occur with much higher frequencies in a larger number of census blocks.</p></li>
				<li>Let's again create another filtered DataFrame. This time only keeping rows where <strong class="inline">HouseAge</strong> is less than or equal to five and name the DataFrame <strong class="inline">dfLess5</strong>. Plot <strong class="inline">Population</strong> and <strong class="inline">MedInc</strong> as a scatterplot, as follows:<p class="snippet">dfLess5 = df[df['HouseAge'] &lt;= 5]</p><p class="snippet">x_vals = dfLess5.Population.values</p><p class="snippet">y_vals = dfLess5.MedInc.values</p><p class="snippet">fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))</p><p class="snippet">plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, c='black')</p><p class="snippet">plt.xlabel('Population', fontsize=18)</p><p class="snippet">plt.ylabel('Median Income', fontsize=16)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer389"><img alt="Figure 9.22: A scatterplot of the median income against population for values of five or less in the HouseAge column&#13;&#10;" src="image/C12626_09_22.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 9.22: A scatterplot of the median income against population for values of five or less in the HouseAge column</h6></li>
				<li>Use yet another <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong> function to fit a kernel density estimation model. Again, the optimal bandwidth is found using Scott's Rule. Replot the histogram and overlay the estimated density, as follows:<p class="snippet">fig = plt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))</p><p class="snippet">ax = seaborn.kdeplot(</p><p class="snippet">    x_vals, </p><p class="snippet">    y_vals,</p><p class="snippet">    kernel='gau',</p><p class="snippet">    cmap='Blues', </p><p class="snippet">    shade=True, </p><p class="snippet">    shade_lowest=False</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p class="snippet">plt.scatter(x_vals, y_vals, c='black', alpha=0.05)</p><p class="snippet">plt.xlabel('Population', fontsize=18)</p><p class="snippet">plt.ylabel('Median Income', fontsize=18)</p><p class="snippet">plt.title('Density Estimation With Scatterplot Overlay', size=18)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p></li>

			<h6>Figure 9.23: The same scatterplot as created in Step 6 with the estimated density overlaid</h6>
			<p>Here, the estimated density shows that census blocks with smaller populations have lower median incomes at higher likelihoods than they have high median incomes. The point of this step is to showcase how kernel density estimation can be used on non-location data.</p>
			<p>When presenting the results of hotspot analysis, some type of map should be involved since hotspot analysis is generally done on location data. Acquiring maps on which estimated densities can be overlaid is not an easy process. Due to copyright issues, we will use very basic maps, called basemaps, on which we can overlay our estimated densities. It will be left to you to extend the knowledge you acquire in this chapter to fancier and more detailed maps. Mapping environments can also be complicated and time-consuming to download and install.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-212"><a id="_idTextAnchor235"/>Exercise 51: Working with Basemaps</h3>
			<p>This exercise leverage<a id="_idTextAnchor236"/>s the <strong class="inline">basemap</strong> module of <strong class="inline">mpl_toolkits</strong>. <strong class="inline">basemap</strong> is a mapping library, which can be used to create basic maps or outlines of geographic regions. These maps can have the results of kernel density estimation overlaid, so that we can clearly see where the hotspots are located.</p>
			<p>First, check whether <strong class="inline">basemap</strong> is installed by running <strong class="inline">import mpl_toolkits.basemap</strong> in a Jupyter notebook. If it loads without error, then you are ready and need to take no further action.

			<p>This estimated density is again a redo of the one that we did in <em class="italics">Exercise 50</em>, <em class="italics">Loading Data and Modeling with Seaborn</em>.

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-213">Activity 22: Analyzing Crime <a id="_idTextAnchor237"/>in London</h3>
			<p>In this activity, we will perform hotspot analysis with kernel density estimation on London crime data from <a href="https://data.police.uk/data/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://data.police.uk/data/</span></a>. Due to the difficulties of working with map data, we will visualize the results of the analysis using <strong class="inline">seaborn</strong>. However, if you feel brave and were able to run all the plots in <em class="italics">Exercise 51</em>, <em class="italics">Working with Basemaps</em> you are encouraged to try using maps.</p>
			<p>The motivation for performing hotspot analysis on this crime data is two-fold. We are asked first to determine where certain types of crimes are occurring in high likelihood, so that police resources can be allocated for maximum impact. Then, as a follow up, we are asked to ascertain whether the hotspots for certain types of crime are changing over time. Both of these questions are answerable using kernel density estimation.</p>

			<p>To clarify one more time, the densities found in this activity should have been overlaid on maps so that we could see exactly what areas these densities cover. Attempting to overlay the results on maps on your own would be encouraged if you have the appropriate mapping platforms at your disposal. If not, you could go to the mapping services available online and use the longitude and latitude pairs to gain insight into the specific locations.</p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-214"><a id="_idTextAnchor238"/>Summary</h2>
			<p>Kernel density estimation is a classic statistical technique that is in the same family of techniques as the histogram. It allows the user to extrapolate out from sample data to make insights and predictions about the population of particular objects or events. This extrapolation comes in the form of a probability density function, which is nice because the results read as likelihoods or probabilities. The quality of this model is dependent on two parameters: the bandwidth value and the kernel function. As discussed, the most crucial component of leveraging kernel density estimation successfully is the setting of an optimal bandwidth. Optimal bandwidths are most frequently identified using grid search cross-validation with pseudo-log-likelihood as the scoring metric. What makes kernel density estimation great is both its simplicity and its applicability to so many fields.</p>
			<p>It is routine to find kernel density estimation models in criminology, epidemiology, meteorology, and real estate to only name a few. Regardless of your area of business, kernel density estimation should be applicable.</p>
			<p>In this book, we explored the best practices for using unsupervised learning techniques in tandem with Python libraries and extracting meaningful information from unstructured data. Now you can confidently build your own models using Python.</p>
