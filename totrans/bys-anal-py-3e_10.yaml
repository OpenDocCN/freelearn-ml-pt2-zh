- en: I wrote this book to introduce the main concepts and practices of Bayesian statistics
    to those who are already familiar with Python and the Python data stack, but not
    very familiar with statistical analysis. Having read the previous ten chapters,
    you should have a reasonable practical understanding of many of the main topics
    of Bayesian statistics. Although you will not be an expert-Bayesian-ninja hacker
    (whatever that could be), you should be able to create your own probabilistic
    models to solve your own data analysis problems. If you are really into Bayesian
    statistics, this book will not be enough – no single book will be enough.

    more practice, enthusiasm, problems, and even more practice. You will also benefit
    from revisiting ideas and concepts from a different perspective. To gather extra
    material, you should check the PyMC documentation at [https://www.pymc.io](https://www.pymc.io),
    the Bambi documentation at [https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/](https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/),
    the ArviZ documentation at [https://python.arviz.org](https://python.arviz.org),
    and the PreliZ documentation at [https://preliz.readthedocs.io](https://preliz.readthedocs.io).
    Be sure to check the examples sections, which are full of many examples of models
    that were covered in this book and many others that were not. With the ArviZ team,
    we are writing an educational resource titled Exploratory Analysis of Bayesian
    Models. We hope this will be a useful reference, especially for newcomers to Bayesian
    modeling: [https://arviz-devs.github.io/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bayesian-Models/](https://arviz-devs.github.io/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bayesian-Models/).'

    find it useful as many of them are presented from a different perspective or using
    different examples. Additionally, some topics complement or extend what we have

- en: One of the side effects of the computer revolution is that any person with a
    modest understanding of a programming language like Python now has access to a
    plethora of computational methods for data analysis, simulations, and other complex
    tasks. I think this is great, but is also an invitation to be extra careful about
    these methods. The way I learned about statistics as an undergrad and how I had
    to memorize the use of canned methods was frustrating, useless, and completely
    unrelated to all of these advances. On a very personal level, this book is perhaps
    a response to that frustrating experience. I tried to write a statistical book
    with an emphasis on a modeling approach and a judicious context-dependent analysis.
    I am unsure whether I have really succeeded on that front, but if I haven’t, one
    reason for it could be that I still need to learn more about this (maybe, even,
    we as a community need to learn more about this). Another reason is that a proper
    statistical analysis should be guided by domain knowledge and context, and providing
    context is generally difficult in an introductory book with a very broad target
    audience. Nevertheless, I hope that I have provided a sane, skeptical perspective
    regarding statistical models, some useful examples, and enough momentum for you
    to keep learning.
