<p><span>Machine learning has generated quite the buzz – from Elon Musk fearing the role of unregulated artificial intelligence in society, to Mark Zuckerberg having a view that contradicts Musk's. </span></p>
<p>So, what exactly is machine learning? <span>Simply put, machine learning is a set of</span> <strong>methods</strong> <span>that can detect patterns in data and use those patterns to make future predictions. Machine learning has found immense value in a wide range of industries, ranging from finance to healthcare. This translates to a higher requirement of talent with the skill capital in the field of machine learning. </span></p>
<p>Broadly speaking, machine learning can be categorized into three main types:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supervised learning</li>
<li>Unsupervised learning</li>
<li>Reinforcement learning</li>
</ul>
<p>Scikit-learn is designed to tackle problems pertaining to supervised and unsupervised learning only, and does not support reinforcement learning at present. </p>

<p>Supervised learning is a form of machine learning in which our data comes with a set of labels or a target variable that is numeric. These labels/categories usually belong to one feature/attribute, which is commonly known as the <strong>target variable. </strong>For instance, each row of your data could either belong to the category of <em>Healthy</em> or <em>Not Healthy</em>.</p>
<p>Given a set of features such as weight, blood sugar levels, and age, we can use the supervised machine learning algorithm to predict whether the person is healthy or not. </p>
<p>In the following simple mathematical expression, <strong>S</strong> is the supervised learning algorithm, <strong>X</strong> is the set of input features, such as weight and age, and <strong>Y</strong> is the target variable with the labels <em>Healthy</em> or <em>Not Healthy</em>:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/8c2e51a7-45a8-4fd6-bc54-2478a8917ae9.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Although supervised machine learning is the most common type of machine learning that is implemented with scikit-learn and in the industry, most datasets typically do not come with predefined labels. Unsupervised learning algorithms are first used to cluster data without labels into distinct groups to which we can then assign labels. This is discussed in detail in the following section.</p>

<p>Unsupervised learning is a form of machine learning in which the algorithm tries to detect/find patterns in data that do not have an outcome/target variable. In other words, we do not have data that comes with pre-existing labels. Thus, the algorithm will typically use a metric such as distance to group data together depending on how close they are to each other. </p>
<p>As discussed in the previous section, most of the data that you will encounter in the real world will not come with a set of predefined labels and, as such, will only have a set of input features without a target attribute. </p>
<p>In the following simple mathematical expression, <strong>U</strong> is the unsupervised learning algorithm, while <strong>X</strong> is a set of input features, such as weight and age:</p>
<div class="CDPAlignCenter CDPAlign"><img src="assets/01564356-cd00-4ed0-8ea6-398512759efa.png" style=""/></div>
<p>Given this data, our objective is to create groups that could potentially be labeled as <em>Healthy</em> or <em>Not Healthy</em>. The unsupervised learning algorithm will use a metric such as distance in order to identify how close a set of points are to each other and how far apart two such groups are. The algorithm will then proceed to cluster these groups into two distinct groups, as illustrated in the following diagram:</p>

<p>Scikit-learn is a free and open source software that helps you tackle supervised and unsupervised machine learning problems. The software is built entirely in Python and utilizes some of the most popular libraries that Python has to offer, namely NumPy and SciPy. </p>

<p>The main reason why scikit-learn is very popular stems from the fact that most of the world's most popular machine learning algorithms can be implemented quite quickly in a plug and play format once you know what the core pipeline is like. Another reason is that popular algorithms for classification such as <strong>logistic regression</strong> and <strong>support vector machines</strong> are written in Cython. Cython is used to give these algorithms <em>C-like</em> performance and thus makes the use of scikit-learn quite efficient in the process. </p>

<p>There are two ways in which you can install scikit-learn on your personal device:</p>
<ul>
<li>By using the pip method</li>
<li>By using the Anaconda method</li>
</ul>
<p>The pip method can be implemented on the macOS/Linux Terminal or the Windows PowerShell, while the Anaconda method will work with the Anaconda prompt.</p>
<p>Choosing between these two methods of installation is pretty straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you would like all the common Python package distributions for data science to be installed in one environment, the Anaconda method works best</li>
<li>If you would like to build you own environment from scratch for scikit-learn, the pip method works best (for advanced users of Python)</li>
</ul>
<div class="packt_tip packt_infobox">This book will be using Python 3.6 for all the code that is displayed throughout every chapter, unless mentioned otherwise.</div>

<p>Scikit-learn requires a few packages to be installed on your device before you can install it. These are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>NumPy</strong>: Version 1.8.2 or greater</li>
<li><strong>SciPy</strong>: Version 0.13.3 or greater</li>
</ul>
<p class="mce-root"/>
<p>These can be installed using the pip method by using the following commands:</p>
<pre><strong>pip3 install NumPy</strong></pre>
<pre><strong>pip3 install SciPy</strong></pre>
<p>Next, we can install scikit-learn using the following code:</p>
<pre><strong>pip3 install scikit-learn</strong></pre>
<p>Additionally, if you already have scikit-learn installed on your device and you simply want to upgrade it to the latest version, you can use the following code:</p>
<pre><strong>pip3 install -U scikit-learn</strong></pre>
<div class="packt_infobox">The version of scikit-learn implemented in the book is 0.19.1.</div>

<p>In the event that you have installed Python using the Anaconda distribution, you can install scikit-learn by using the following code in the Anaconda prompt:</p>
<p>The first step is to install the dependencies:</p>
<pre><strong>conda install NumPy</strong></pre>
<pre><strong>conda install SciPy</strong></pre>
<p>Next, we can install scikit-learn by using the following code:</p>
<pre><strong>conda install scikit-learn</strong></pre>
<p>Additionally, if you already have scikit-learn installed with the Anaconda distribution, you can upgrade it to the latest version by using the following code in the Anaconda prompt:</p>
<pre><strong>conda update scikit-learn</strong></pre>
<div class="packt_tip">When upgrading or uninstalling scikit-learn that has been installed with Anaconda, avoid using the pip method at all costs as doing so is most likely going to fail upgrading or removing all the required files. Stick with either the pip method or the Anaconda method in order to maintain consistency. </div>
