<blockquote>&#13;
<p>Statistician is the technical term for a cynical data scientist. – Jim Savage</p>&#13;
</blockquote>&#13;
<p>I wrote this book to introduce the main concepts and practices of Bayesian statistics to those who are already familiar with Python and the Python data stack, but not very familiar with statistical analysis. Having read the previous ten chapters, you should have a reasonable practical understanding of many of the main topics of Bayesian statistics. Although you will not be an expert-Bayesian-ninja hacker (whatever that could be), you should be able to create your own probabilistic models to solve your own data analysis problems. If you are really into Bayesian statistics, this book will not be enough – no single book will be enough.</p>&#13;
<p>To become fluent in Bayesian statistics, you will need practice, time, patience, more practice, enthusiasm, problems, and even more practice. You will also benefit from revisiting ideas and concepts from a different perspective. To gather extra material, you should check the PyMC documentation at <a href="https://www.pymc.io" class="url">https://www.pymc.io</a>, the Bambi documentation at <a href="https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/" class="url">https://bambinos.github.io/bambi/</a>, the ArviZ documentation at <a href="https://python.arviz.org" class="url">https://python.arviz.org</a>, and the PreliZ documentation at <a href="https://preliz.readthedocs.io" class="url">https://preliz.readthedocs.io</a>. Be sure to check the examples sections, which are full of many examples of models that were covered in this book and many others that were not. With the ArviZ team, we are writing an educational resource titled Exploratory Analysis of Bayesian Models. We hope this will be a useful reference, especially for newcomers to Bayesian modeling: <a href="https://arviz-devs.github.io/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bayesian-Models/" class="url">https://arviz-devs.github.io/Exploratory-Analysis-of-Bayesian-Models/</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>If you would like to provide any feedback, either on the text or the code, you can file an issue at <a href="https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP3" class="url">https://github.com/aloctavodia/BAP3</a>. If you have questions about Bayesian statistics, especially those related to PyMC, ArviZ, or Bambi, you can ask questions at <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io" class="url">https://discourse.pymc.io</a>.</p>&#13;
<p>In the following list, I have put together some resources that I think you may find useful to continue learning about Bayesian statistics:</p>&#13;
<ul>&#13;
<li><p>In the repository at <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources" class="url">https://github.com/pymc-devs/pymc-resources</a>, you can find code in Python/PyMC from books originally written in other programming languages.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>Bayesian Modeling and Computation in Python</em> is another book I have co-authored: <a href="https://bayesiancomputationbook.com" class="url">https://bayesiancomputationbook.com</a>. While some of the topics overlap with the ones presented in this book, you may still find it useful as many of them are presented from a different perspective or using different examples. Additionally, some topics complement or extend what we have discussed here.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p>There are many good books about Bayesian statistics out there, but some of my favorite introductory/practical ones are <em>Statistical</em> <em>Rethinking</em>, <em>Doing Bayesian Data Analysis</em>, <em>Regression and other</em> <em>stories</em>, and <em>Bayes rules!</em> If you want something more on the machine learning side and with more math, <em>Machine Learning: A Probabilistic</em> <em>Perspective</em> is a great resource.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>Learning Bayesian Statistics</em> is a fortnightly podcast where researchers, developers, and practitioners from many different fields talk about Bayesian statistics: <a href="https://learnbayesstats.com/" class="url">https://learnbayesstats.com/</a>.</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>PyMCon</em> is an asynchronous-first virtual conference for the Bayesian community: <a href="https://pymcon.com/" class="url">https://pymcon.com/</a>. There are <span id="dx1-211001"/>many good talks there, and also an opportunity for you to present your own talk!</p></li>&#13;
<li><p><em>Intuitive Bayes</em> is a paid series of courses and community-designed to get you from Bayes-curious to practitioner real fast: <a href="https://www.intuitivebayes.com/" class="url">https://www.intuitivebayes.com/</a>.</p></li>&#13;

<p>As a child, I dreamed of flying cars, clean unlimited energy, vacations on Mars or the Moon, and a global government pursuing the well-being of the entire human race... yeah, I know... I used to be a dreamer! For many reasons, we have none of that. Instead, we got something that was completely unimaginable, at least for me, just a couple of decades ago: relatively easy access to very powerful computer methods (at least for some people).</p>&#13;
<p>One of the side effects of the computer revolution is that any person with a modest understanding of a programming language like Python now has access to a plethora of computational methods for data analysis, simulations, and other complex tasks. I think this is great, but is also an invitation to be extra careful about these methods. The way I learned about statistics as an undergrad and how I had to memorize the use of canned methods was frustrating, useless, and completely unrelated to all of these advances. On a very personal level, this book is perhaps a response to that frustrating experience. I tried to write a statistical book with an emphasis on a modeling approach and a judicious context-dependent analysis. I am unsure whether I have really succeeded on that front, but if I haven’t, one reason for it could be that I still need to learn more about this (maybe, even, we as a community need to learn more about this). Another reason is that a proper statistical analysis should be guided by domain knowledge and context, and providing context is generally difficult in an introductory book with a very broad target audience. Nevertheless, I hope that I have provided a sane, skeptical perspective regarding statistical models, some useful examples, and enough momentum for you to keep learning.</p>&#13;
