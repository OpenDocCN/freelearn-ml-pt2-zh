    how the biological brain works, in order to design artificial intelligence (AI),
    Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published the first concept of a simplified
    brain cell, the so-called **McCulloch-Pitts** (**MCP**) neuron, in 1943 (*A Logical
    Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity*, *W. S. McCulloch* and *W.
    Pitts*, *Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics*, 5(4): 115-133, *1943*). Biological
    neurons are interconnected nerve cells in the brain that are involved in the processing
    and transmitting of chemical and electrical signals, which is illustrated in the

    an output signal is generated that will be passed on by the axon.

    automatically learn the optimal weight coefficients that would then be multiplied
    with the input features in order to make the decision of whether a neuron fires
    (transmits a signal) or not. In the context of supervised learning and classification,

    well our perceptron performed during the training. The `np.dot` function that

    in pure Python via `sum([i * j for i, j in zip(a, b)])`. However, the advantage
    of using NumPy over classic Python for loop structures is that its arithmetic
    operations are vectorized. **Vectorization** means that an elemental arithmetic
    operation is automatically applied to all elements in an array. By formulating
    our arithmetic operations as a sequence of instructions on an array, rather than
    performing a set of operations for each element at a time, we can make better
    use of our modern central processing unit (CPU) architectures with **single instruction,
    multiple data** (**SIMD**) support. Furthermore, NumPy uses highly optimized linear
    algebra libraries, such as **Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms** (**BLAS**) and
    **Linear Algebra Package** (**LAPACK**), that have been written in C or Fortran.
