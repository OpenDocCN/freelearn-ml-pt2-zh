- en: Would you like to understand how and why machine learning techniques and data
    analytics are spearheading enterprises globally?  From analyzing bioinformatics
    to predicting climate change, machine learning plays an increasingly pivotal role
    in our society.

- en: Although the real-world applications may seem complex, this book simplifies
    supervised learning for beginners with a step-by-step interactive approach. Working
    with real-time datasets, you'll learn how supervised learning, when used with
    Python, can produce efficient predictive models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Starting with the fundamentals of supervised learning, you'll quickly move to
    understand how to automate manual tasks and the process of assessing data using
    Jupyter and Python libraries like pandas. Next, you'll use data exploration and
    visualization techniques to develop powerful supervised learning models, before
    understanding how to distinguish variables and represent their relationships using
    scatter plots, heatmaps, and box plots. After using regression and classification
    models on real-time datasets to predict future outcomes, you'll grasp advanced
    ensemble techniques such as boosting and random forests. Finally, you'll learn
    the importance of model evaluation in supervised learning and study metrics to
    evaluate regression and classification tasks.

    real-life supervised learning Python projects.

- en: If you are a beginner or a data scientist who is just getting started and looking
    to learn how to implement machine learning algorithms to build predicting models,
    then this book is for you. To expedite the learning process, a solid understanding
    of Python programming is recommended as you'll be editing the classes or functions
    instead of creating from scratch.
