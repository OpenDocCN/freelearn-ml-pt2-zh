			<p>Topic modeling is one facet of <strong class="keyword">natural language processing</strong> (<strong class="keyword">NLP</strong>), the field of computer science exploring the relationship between computers and human language, which has been increasing in popularity with the increased availability of textual datasets. NLP can deal with language in almost any form, including text, speech, and images. Besides topic modeling, sentiment analysis, object character recognition, and lexical semantics are noteworthy NLP algorithms. Nowadays, the data being collected and needing analysis less frequently comes in standard tabular forms and more frequently coming in less structured forms, including documents, images, and audio files. As such, successful data science practitioners need to be fluent in methodologies used for handling these diverse datasets. </p>
			<p>Here is a demonstration of identifying words in a text and assigning them to topics:</p>

			<h6>Figure 7.1: Example of identifying words in a text and assigning them to topics</h6>
			<p>Your immediate question is probably <em class="italics">what are topics</em>? Let's answer that question with an example. You could imagine, or perhaps have noticed, that on days when major events take place, such as national elections, natural disasters, or sport championships, the posts on social media websites tend to focus on those events. Posts generally reflect, in some way, the day's events, and they will do so in varying ways. Posts can and will have a number of divergent viewpoints. If we had tweets about the World Cup final, the topics of those tweets could cover divergent viewpoints, ranging from the quality of the refereeing to fan behavior. In the United States, the president delivers an annual speech in mid to late January called the State of the Union. With sufficient numbers of social media posts, we would be able to infer or predict high-level reactions – topics – to the speech from the social media community by grouping posts using the specific keywords contained in them.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-138"><a id="_idTextAnchor159"/>Topic Models</h3>
			<p>Topic models fall into the unsupervised learning bucket because, almost always, the topics being identified are not known in advance. So, no target exists on which we can perform regression or classification modeling. In terms of unsupervised learning, topic models most resemble clustering algorithms, specifically k-means clustering. You'll recall that, in k-means clustering, the number of clusters is established first and then the model assigns each data point to one of the predetermined number of clusters. The same is generally true in topic models. We select the number of topics at the start and then the model isolates the words that form that number of topics. This is a great jumping-off point for a high-level topic modeling overview.</p>
			<p>Before that, let's check that the correct environment and libraries are installed and ready for use. The following table lists the required libraries and their main purposes:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer217">
					<img alt="Figure 7.2: Table showing different libraries and their use" src="image/C12626_07_02.jpg"/>

			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.2: Table showing different libraries and their use</h6>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-139"><a id="_idTextAnchor160"/>Exercise 27: Setting Up the Environment</h3>
			<p>To check whether the environment is ready for topic modeling, we will perform several steps. The first of which involves loading all the libraries that will be needed in this chapter:</p>
			<h4>Note</h4>
			<p class="callout">If any or all of these libraries are not currently installed, install the required packages via the command line using <strong class="inline">pip</strong>. For example, <strong class="inline">pip install langdetect</strong>, if not installed already.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Open a new Jupyter notebook.</li>
				<li>Import the requisite libraries:<p class="snippet">import langdetect</p><p class="snippet">import matplotlib.pyplot</p><p class="snippet">import nltk</p><p class="snippet">import numpy</p><p class="snippet">import pandas</p><p class="snippet">import pyLDAvis</p><p class="snippet">import pyLDAvis.sklearn</p><p class="snippet">import regex</p><p class="snippet">import sklearn</p><p>Note that not all of these packages are used for cleaning the data; some of them are used in the actual modeling, but it is nice to import all of the required libraries at once, so let's take care of all library importing now.</p></li>
				<li>Libraries not yet installed will return the following error:<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer218"><img alt="Figure 7.3: Library not installed error" src="image/C12626_07_03.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.3: Library not installed error</h6><p>If this error is returned, install the relevant libraries via the command line as previously discussed. Once successfully installed, rerun the library import process using <strong class="inline">import</strong>.</p></li>
				<li>Certain textual data cleaning and preprocessing processes require word dictionaries (more to come). In this step, we will install two of these dictionaries. If the <strong class="inline">nltk</strong> library is imported, the following code can be executed:<p class="snippet">nltk.download('wordnet')</p><p class="snippet">nltk.download('stopwords')</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer219"><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_04.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.4: Importing libraries and downloading dictionaries</h6></li>
				<li>Run the <strong class="inline">matplotlib</strong> magic and specify inline so that the plots print inside the notebook:<p class="snippet">%matplotlib inline</p></li>
			</ol>
			<p>The notebook and environment are now set and ready for data loading.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-140"><a id="_idTextAnchor161"/>A High-Level Overview of Topic Models</h3>
			<p>When it comes to analyzing large volumes of potentially related text data, topic models are one go-to approach. By related, we mean that the documents ideally come from the same source. That is, survey results, tweets, and newspaper articles would not normally be analyzed simultaneously in the same model. It is certainly possible to analyze them together, but the results are liable to be very vague and therefore meaningless. To run any topic model, the only data requirement is the documents themselves. No additional data, meta or otherwise, is required.</p>
			<p>In the simplest terms, topic models identify the abstract topics (also known as themes) in a collection of documents, referred to as a <strong class="keyword">corpus</strong>, using the words contained in the documents. That is, if a sentence contains the words salary, employee, and meeting, it would be safe to assume that that sentence is about, or that its topic is, work. It is of note that the documents making up the corpus need not be documents as traditionally defined – think letters or contracts. A document could be anything containing text, including tweets, news headlines, or transcribed speech. </p>
			<p>Topic models assume that words in the same document are related and use that assumption to define abstract topics by finding groups of words that repeatedly appear in close proximity. In this way, these models are classic pattern recognition algorithms where the patterns being detected are made up of words. The general topic modeling algorithm has four main steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Determine the number of topics.</li>
				<li>Scan the documents and identify co-occurring words or phrases.</li>
				<li>Auto-learn groups (or clusters) of words characterizing the documents.</li>
				<li>Output abstract topics characterizing the corpus as word groupings.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>As step 1 notes, the number of topics needs to be selected before fitting the model. Selecting an appropriate number of topics can be tricky, but, as is the case with most machine learning models, this parameter can be optimized by fitting several models using different numbers of topics and selecting the best model based on some performance metric. We'll dive into this process again later.</p>
			<p>The following is the generic topic modeling workflow:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer220">
					<img alt="Figure 7.5: The generic topic modeling workflow" src="image/C12626_07_05.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.5: The generic topic modeling workflow</h6>
			<p>It is important to select the best number of topics possible, as this parameter can majorly impact topic coherence. This is because the model finds groups of words that best fit the corpus under the constraint of a predefined number of topics. If the number of topics is too high, the topics become inappropriately narrow. Overly specific topics are referred to as <strong class="keyword">over-cooked</strong>. Likewise, if the number of topics is too low, the topics become generic and vague. These types of topics are considered <strong class="keyword">under-cooked</strong>. Over-cooked and under-cooked topics can sometimes be fixed by decreasing or increasing the number of topics, respectively. A frequent and unavoidable result of topic models is that, frequently, at least one topic will be problematic.</p>
			<p>A key aspect of topic models is that they do not produce specific one-word or one-phrase topics, but rather collections of words, each of which represents an abstract topic. Recall the imaginary sentence about work from before. The topic model built to identify the topics of some hypothetical corpus to which that sentence belongs would not return the word work as a topic. It would instead return a collection of words, such as paycheck, employee, and boss; words that describe the topic and from which the one-word or one-phrase topic could be inferred. This is because topic models understand word <strong class="keyword">proximity</strong>, not context. The model has no idea what paycheck, employee, and boss mean; it only knows that these words, generally, whenever they appear, appear in close proximity to one another:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer221">
					<img alt="Figure 7.6: Inferring topics from word groupings" src="image/C12626_07_06.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.6: Inferring topics from word groupings</h6>
			<p>Topic models can be used to predict the topic(s) belonging to unseen documents, but, if you are going to make predictions, it is important to recognize that topic models only know the words used to train them. That is, if the unseen documents have words that were not in the training data, the model will not be able to process those words even if they link to one of the topics identified in the training data. Because of this fact, topic models tend to be used more for exploratory analysis and inference more so than for prediction.</p>
			<p>Each topic model outputs two matrices. The first matrix contains words against topics. It lists each word related to each topic with some quantification of the relationship. Given the number of words being considered by the model, each topic is only going to be described by a relatively small number of words. Words can either be assigned to one topic or to multiple topics at differing quantifications. Whether words are assigned to one or multiple topics depends on the algorithm. Similarly, the second matrix contains documents against topics. It lists each document related to a topic with some quantification of how related each document is to that topic. </p>
			<p>When discussing topic modeling, it is important to continually reinforce the fact that the word groups representing topics are not related conceptually, only by proximity. The frequent proximity of certain words in the documents is enough to define topics because of an assumption stated previously, which is that all words in the same document are related. However, this assumption may either not be true or the words may be too generic to form coherent topics. Interpreting abstract topics involves balancing the innate characteristics of text data with the generated word groupings. Text data, and language in general, is highly variable, complex, and has context, which means any generalized result needs to be consumed cautiously. This is not to downplay or invalidate the results of the model. Given thoroughly cleaned documents and an appropriate number of topics, word groupings, as we will see, can be a good guide as to what is contained in a corpus and can effectively be incorporated into larger data systems.</p>
			<p>We have discussed some of the limitations of topic models already, but there are some additional points to consider. The noisy nature of text data can lead topic models to assign words unrelated to one of the topics to that topic. Again, consider the sentence about work from before. The word meeting could appear in the word grouping representing the topic work. It is also possible that the word long could be in that group, but the word long is not directly related to work. Long may be in the group because it frequently appears in close proximity to the word meeting. Therefore, long would probably be considered to be spuriously correlated to work and should probably be removed from the topic grouping, if possible. Spuriously correlated words in word groupings can cause significant problems when analyzing data. </p>
			<p>This is not necessarily a flaw in the model, it is, instead, a characteristic of the model that, given noisy data, could extract quirks from the data that might negatively impact the results. Spurious correlations could be the result of how, where, or when the data was collected. If the documents were collected only in some specific geographic region, words associated with that region could be incorrectly, albeit accidentally, linked to one or many of the word groupings output from the model. Note that, with additional words in the word group, we could be attaching more documents to that topic than should be attached. It should be straightforward that, if we shrink the number of words belonging to a topic, then that topic will be assigned to fewer documents. Keep in mind that this is not a bad thing. We want each word grouping to contain only words that make sense so that we assign the appropriate topics to the appropriate documents.</p>
			<p>There are many topic modeling algorithms, but perhaps the two best known are <strong class="keyword">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</strong> and <strong class="keyword">Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</strong>. We will discuss both in detail later on.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-141"><a id="_idTextAnchor162"/>Business Applications</h3>
			<p>Despite its limitations, topic modeling can provide actionable insights that drive business value if used correctly and in the appropriate context. Let's now review one of the biggest applications of topic models.</p>
			<p>One of the use cases is exploratory data analysis on new text data where the underlying structure of the dataset is unknown. This is the equivalent to plotting and computing summary statistics for an unseen dataset featuring numeric and categorical variables whose characteristics need to be understood before more sophisticated analyses can be reasonably performed. With the results of topic modeling, the usability of this dataset in future modeling exercises is ascertainable. For example, if the topic model returns clear and distinct topics, then that dataset would be a great candidate for further clustering-type analyses.</p>
			<p>Effectively, what determining topics does is to create an additional variable that can be used to sort, categorize, and/or chunk data. If our topic model returns cars, farming, and electronics as abstract topics, we could filter our large text dataset down to just the documents with farming as a topic. Once filtered, we could perform further analyses, including sentiment analysis, another round of topic modeling, or any other analysis we could think up. Beyond defining the topics present in a corpus, topic modeling returns a lot of other information indirectly that could also be used to break a large dataset down and understand its characteristics. </p>
			<p>A representation of sorting documents is shown here:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer222">
					<img alt="Figure 7.7: Sorting/categorizing documents" src="image/C12626_07_07.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.7: Sorting/categorizing documents</h6>
			<p>Among those characteristics is topic prevalence. Think about performing an analysis on an open response survey that is designed to gauge the response to a product. We could imagine the topic model returning topics in the form of sentiment. One group of words might be good, excellent, recommend, and quality, while the other might be garbage, broken, poor, and disappointing. Given this style of survey, the topics themselves may not be that surprising, but what would be interesting is that we could count the number of documents containing each topic. From the counts, we could say things like x-percent of the survey respondents had a positive reaction to the product, while only y-percent of the respondents had a negative reaction. Essentially, what we would have created is a rough version of a sentiment analysis.</p>
			<p>Currently, the most frequent use for a topic model is as a component of a recommendation engine. The emphasis today is on personalization – delivering products to customers that are specifically designed and curated for individual customers. Take websites, news or otherwise, devoted to the propagation of articles. Companies such as Yahoo and Medium need customers to keep reading in order to stay in business, and one way to keep customers reading is to feed them articles that they would be more inclined to read. This is where topic modeling comes in. Using a corpus made up of articles previously read by an individual, a topic model would essentially tell us what types of articles said subscriber likes to read. The company could then go to its inventory and find articles with similar topics and send them to the individual either via their account page or email. This is custom curation to facilitate simplicity and ease of use while also maintaining engagement.</p>
			<p>Before we get into prepping data for our model, let's quickly load and explore the data.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-142"><a id="_idTextAnchor163"/>Exercise 28: Data Loading</h3>
			<p>In this exercise we will load the data from a dataset and format it.

			<h6>Figure 7.9: A list of headlines</h6>
			<p>With the data now loaded and correctly formatted, let's talk about textual data cleaning and then jump into some actual cleaning and preprocessing. For instructional purposes, the cleaning process will initially be built and executed on only one headline. Once we have established the process and tested it on the example headline, we will go back and run the process on every headline. </p>
			<h2 id="_idParaDest-143"><a id="_idTextAnchor164"/>Cleaning Text Data</h2>
			<p>A key component of all successful modeling exercises is a clean dataset that has been appropriately and sufficiently preprocessed for the specific data type and analysis being performed. Text data is no exception, as it is virtually unusable in its raw form. It does not matter what algorithm is being run: if the data isn't properly prepared, the results will be at best meaningless and at worst misleading. As the saying goes, <em class="italics">"garbage in, garbage out."</em> For topic modeling, the goal of data cleaning is to isolate the words in each document that could be relevant by removing everything that could be obstructive.</p>
			<p>Data cleaning and preprocessing is almost always specific to the dataset, meaning that each dataset will require a unique set of cleaning and preprocessing steps selected to specifically handle the issues in the dataset being worked on. With text data, cleaning and preprocessing steps can include language filtering, removing URLs and screen names, lemmatizing, and stop word removal, among others. In the forthcoming exercises, a dataset featuring news headlines is cleaned for topic modeling.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-144"><a id="_idTextAnchor165"/>Data Cleaning Techniques</h3>
			<p>To reiterate a previous point, the goal of cleaning text for topic modeling is to isolate the words in each document that could be relevant to finding the abstract topics of the corpus. This means removing common words, short words (generally more common), numbers, and punctuation. No hard and fast process exists for cleaning data, so it is important to understand the typical problem points in the type of data being cleaned and to do extensive exploratory work.</p>
			<p>Let's now discuss some of the text data cleaning techniques that we will employ. One of the first things that needs to be done when doing any modeling task involving text is to determine the language(s) of the text. In this dataset, most of the headlines are English, so we will remove the non-English headlines for simplicity. Building models on non-English text data requires additional skill sets, the least of which is fluency in the particular language being modeled.</p>
			<p>The next crucial step in data cleaning is to remove all elements of the documents that are either not relevant to word-based models or are potential sources of noise that could obscure the results. Elements needing removal could include website addresses, punctuation, numbers, and stop words. Stop words are basically simple, everyday words, including we, are, and the. It is important to note that there is no definitive dictionary of stop words; instead, every dictionary varies slightly. Despite the differences, each dictionary represents a number of common words that are assumed to be topic agnostic. Topic models try to identify words that are both frequent and infrequent enough to be descriptive of an abstract topic. </p>
			<p>The removal of website addresses has a similar motivation. Specific website addresses will appear very rarely, but even if one specific website address appears enough to be linked to a topic, website addresses are not interpretable in the same way as words. Removing irrelevant information from the documents reduces the amount of noise that could either prevent model convergence or obscure results.</p>
			<p><strong class="keyword">Lemmatization</strong>, like language detection, is an important component of all modeling activities involving text. It is the process of reducing words to their base form as a way to group words that should all be the same but are not. Consider the words running, runs, and ran. All three of these words have the base form of run. A great aspect of lemmatizing is that it looks at all the words in a sentence, or in other words it considers the context, before determining how to alter each word. Lemmatization, like most of the preceding cleaning techniques, simply reduces the amount of noise in the data, so that we can identify clean and interpretable topics. </p>
			<p>Now, with basic knowledge of textual cleaning techniques, let's apply it to real-world data. </p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-145"><a id="_idTextAnchor166"/>Exercise 29: Cleaning Data Step by Step</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will learn how to implement some key techniques for cleaning text data. Each technique will be explained as we work through the exercise. After every cleaning step, the example headline is output using <strong class="inline">print</strong>, so we can watch the evolution from raw data to modeling-ready data:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select the fifth headline as the example on which we will build and test the cleaning process. The fifth headline is not a random choice; it was selected because it contains specific problems that will be addressed during the cleaning process:<p class="snippet">example = raw[5]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer225"><img alt="Figure 7.10: The fifth headline" src="image/C12626_07_10.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.10: The fifth headline</h6></li>
				<li>Use the <strong class="inline">langdetect</strong> library to detect the language of each headline. If the language is anything other than English ("<strong class="inline">en</strong>"), remove that headline from the dataset:<p class="snippet">def do_language_identifying(txt):</p><p class="snippet">    try: the_language = langdetect.detect(txt)</p><p class="snippet">    except: the_language = 'none'</p><p class="snippet">    return the_language</p><p class="snippet">print("DETECTED LANGUAGE:\n{lang}\n".format(lang=do_language_identifying(example)</p><p class="snippet">))</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer226"><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_11.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.11: Detected language</h6></li>
				<li>Split the string containing the headline into pieces, called <strong class="keyword">tokens</strong>, using the white spaces. The returned object is a list of words and numbers that make up the headline. Breaking the headline string into tokens makes the cleaning and preprocessing process simpler:<p class="snippet">example = example.split(" ")</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer227"><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_12.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.12: String split using white spaces</h6></li>

				<li>Change all uppercase letters to lowercase. Converting everything to lowercase is not a mandatory step, but it does help reduce complexity. With everything lowercase, there is less to keep track of and therefore less chance of error:<p class="snippet">example = [i.lower() if i not in "URL" else i for i in example]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer231"><img alt="Figure 7.16: Uppercase letters converted to lowercase" src="image/C12626_07_16.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.16: Uppercase letters converted to lowercase</h6></li>
				<li>Remove the <strong class="inline">"URL"</strong> string that was added as a placeholder in <em class="italics">step 4</em>. The previously added <strong class="inline">"URL" </strong>string is not actually needed for modeling. If it seems harmless to leave it in, consider that the <strong class="inline">"URL"</strong> string could appear naturally in a headline and we do not want to artificially boost its number of appearances. Also, the <strong class="inline">"URL"</strong> string does not appear in every headline, so by leaving it in we could be unintentionally creating a connection between the <strong class="inline">"URL"</strong> strings and a topic:<p class="snippet">example = [i for i in example if i not in "URL"]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer232"><img alt="Figure 7.17: String URL removed" src="image/C12626_07_17.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.17: String URL removed</h6></li>
				<li>Load in the <strong class="inline">stopwords</strong> dictionary from <strong class="inline">nltk</strong> and print it:<p class="snippet">list_stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words("English")</p><p class="snippet">list_stop_words = [regex.sub("[^\\w\\s]", "", i) for i in list_stop_words]</p><p class="snippet">print(list_stop_words)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer233"><img alt="Figure 7.18: List of stop words" src="image/C12626_07_18.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.18: List of stop words</h6><p>Before using the dictionary, it is important to reformat the words to match the formatting of our headlines. That involves confirming that everything is lowercase and without punctuation.</p></li>
				<li>Now that we have correctly formatted the <strong class="inline">stopwords</strong> dictionary, use it to remove all stop words from the headline:<p class="snippet">example = [i for i in example if i not in list_stop_words]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer234"><img alt="Figure 7.19: Stop words removed from the headline" src="image/C12626_07_19.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.19: Stop words removed from the headline</h6></li>
				<li>Perform lemmatization by defining a function that can be applied to each headline individually. Lemmatizing requires loading the wordnet dictionary:<p class="snippet">def do_lemmatizing(wrd):</p><p class="snippet">    out = nltk.corpus.wordnet.morphy(wrd)</p><p class="snippet">    return (wrd if out is None else out)</p><p class="snippet">example = [do_lemmatizing(i) for i in example]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer235"><img alt="Figure 7.20: Output after performing lemmatization" src="image/C12626_07_20.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.20: Output after performing lemmatization</h6></li>
				<li>Remove all words with a length of four of less from the list of tokens. The assumption around this step is that short words are, in general, more common and therefore will not drive the types of insights we are looking to extract from the topic models. This is the final step of data cleaning and preprocessing:<p class="snippet">example = [i for i in example if len(i) &gt;= 5]</p><p class="snippet">print(example)</p><p>The output is as follows:</p></li>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.21: Headline number five post-cleaning</h6>
			<p>Now that we have worked through the cleaning and preprocessing steps individually on one headline, we need to apply those steps to every one of the nearly 100,000 headlines. Applying the steps to every headline the way we applied them to the single headline, which is in a manual way, is not feasible.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-146"><a id="_idTextAnchor167"/>Exercise 30: Complete Data Cleaning</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will consolidate steps 2 through 12 from <em class="italics">Exercise 29</em>, <em class="italics">Cleaning Data Step-by-Step</em>, into one function that we can apply to every headline. The function will take one headline in string format as an input and output one cleaned headline as a list of tokens. The topic models require that documents be formatted as strings instead of as lists of tokens, so, in <em class="italics">step 4</em>, the lists of tokens are converted back into strings:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define a function that contains all the individual steps of the cleaning process from <em class="italics">Exercise 29</em>, <em class="italics">Cleaning Data Step-by-step</em>:<p class="snippet">def do_headline_cleaning(txt):</p><p class="snippet">      # identify language of tweet</p><p class="snippet">      # return null if language not English</p><p class="snippet">    lg = do_language_identifying(txt)</p><p class="snippet">    if lg != 'en': </p><p class="snippet">        return None</p><p class="snippet">      # split the string on whitespace</p><p class="snippet">    out = txt.split(" ")</p><p class="snippet">      # identify urls</p><p class="snippet">      # replace with URL</p><p class="snippet">    out = ['URL' if bool(regex.search("http[s]?://", i)) else i for i in out]</p><p class="snippet">      # remove all punctuation</p><p class="snippet">    out = [regex.sub("[^\\w\\s]|\n", "", i) for i in out]</p><p class="snippet">      # remove all numerics</p><p class="snippet">    out = [regex.sub("^[0-9]*$", "", i) for i in out]</p><p class="snippet">      # make all non-keywords lowercase</p><p class="snippet">    out = [i.lower() if i not in "URL" else i for i in out]</p><p class="snippet">      # remove URL</p><p class="snippet">    out = [i for i in out if i not in "URL"]</p><p class="snippet">      # remove stopwords</p><p class="snippet">    list_stop_words = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words("English")</p><p class="snippet">    list_stop_words = [regex.sub("[^\\w\\s]", "", i) for i in list_stop_words]</p><p class="snippet">    out = [i for i in out if i not in list_stop_words]</p><p class="snippet">      # lemmatizing</p><p class="snippet">    out = [do_lemmatizing(i) for i in out]</p><p class="snippet">      # keep words 5 or more characters long</p><p class="snippet">    out = [i for i in out if len(i) &gt;= 5]</p><p class="snippet">    return out</p></li>
				<li>Execute the function on each headline. The <strong class="inline">map</strong> function in Python is a nice way to apply a user-defined function to each element of a list. Convert the <strong class="inline">map</strong> object to a list and assign it to the <strong class="inline">clean</strong> variable. The <strong class="inline">clean</strong> variable is a list of lists:<p class="snippet">clean = list(map(do_headline_cleaning, raw))</p></li>
				<li>In <strong class="inline">do_headline_cleaning</strong>, <strong class="inline">None</strong> is returned if the language of the headline is detected as being any language other than English. The elements of the final cleaned list should only be lists, not <strong class="inline">None</strong>, so remove all <strong class="inline">None</strong> types. Use <strong class="inline">print</strong> to display the first five cleaned headlines and the length of the <strong class="inline">clean</strong> variable:<p class="snippet">clean = list(filter(None.__ne__, clean))</p><p class="snippet">print("HEADLINES:\n{lines}\n".format(lines=clean[:5]))</p><p class="snippet">print("LENGTH:\n{length}\n".format(length=len(clean)))</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer237"><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_22.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.22: Headline and its length</h6></li>
				<li>For every individual headline, concatenate the tokens using a white space separator. The headlines should now be an unstructured collection of words, nonsensical to the human reader, but ideal for topic modeling:<p class="snippet">clean_sentences = [" ".join(i) for i in clean]</p><p class="snippet">print(clean_sentences[0:10])</p><p>The cleaned headlines should resemble the following:</p></li>

			<h6>Figure 7.23: Headlines cleaned for modeling</h6>
			<p>To recap, what the cleaning and preprocessing work effectively does is strip out the noise from the data, so that the model can hone in on elements of the data that could actually drive insights. For example, words that are agnostic to any topic (or stop words) should not be informing topics, but, by accident alone if left in, could be informing topics. In an effort to avoid what we could call "<em class="italics">fake signals</em>," we remove those words. Likewise, since topic models cannot discern context, punctuation is irrelevant and is therefore removed. Even if the model could find the topics without removing the noise from the data, the uncleaned data could have thousands to millions of extra words and random characters to parse, depending on the number of documents in the corpus, which could significantly increase the computational demands. So, data cleaning is an integral part of topic modeling.</p>

			<p>In this activity, we will load and clean Twitter data for modeling done in subsequent activities. Our usage of the headline data is ongoing, so let's complete this activity in a separate Jupyter notebook, but with all the same requirements and imported libraries.</p>
			<p>The goal is to take the raw tweet data, clean it, and produce the same output that we did in <em class="italics">Step 4</em> of the previous exercise. That output should be a list whose length is similar to the number of rows in the raw data file. The length is similar to, meaning potentially not equal to, the number of rows, because tweets can get dropped in the cleaning process for reasons including that the tweet might not be in English. Each element of the list should represent one tweet and should contain just the words in the tweet that might be relevant to topic formation.</p>

			<p>In 2003, David Biel, Andrew Ng, and Michael Jordan published their article on the topic modeling algorithm known as <strong class="keyword">Latent Dirichlet Allocation</strong> (<strong class="keyword">LDA</strong>). LDA is a generative probabilistic model. This means that we assume the process, which is articulated in terms of probabilities, by which the data was generated is known and then work backward from the data to the parameters that generated it. In this case, it is the topics that generated the data that are of interest. The process discussed here is the most basic form of LDA, but for learning, it is also the most comprehensible.</p>
			<p>For each document in the corpus, the assumed generative process is:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Select <img alt="A picture containing tableware&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_01.png"/>, where <img alt="A picture containing music&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_02.png"/> is the number of words.</li>
				<li>Select <img alt="A drawing of a face&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_03.png"/>, where <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_04.png"/> is the distribution of topics.</li>
				<li>For each of the <img alt="A picture containing music&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_05.png"/> words <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_06.png"/>, select topic <img alt="A drawing of a face&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_07.png"/>, and select word <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_08.png"/> from <img alt="A picture containing clipart&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_09.png"/>.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Let's go through the generative process in a bit more detail. The preceding three steps repeat for every document in the corpus. The initial step is to choose the number of words in the document by sampling from, in most cases, the <em class="italics">Poisson</em> distribution. It is important to note that, because N is independent of the other variables, the randomness associated with its generation is mostly ignored in the derivation of the algorithm. Coming after the selection of <em class="italics">N</em> is the generation of the topic mixture or distribution of topics, which is unique to each document. Think of this as a per-document list of topics with probabilities representing the amount of the document represented by each topic. Consider three topics: A, B, and C. An example document could be 100% topic A, 75% topic B, and 25% topic C, or an infinite number of other combinations. Lastly, the specific words in the document are selected via a probability statement conditioned on the selected topic and the distribution of words for that topic. Note that documents are not really generated in this way, but it is a reasonable proxy.</p>
			<p>This process can be thought of as a distribution over distributions. A document is selected from the collection (distribution) of documents, and from that document one topic is selected, via the multinomial distribution, from the probability distribution of topics for that document generated by the Dirichlet distribution:</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.25: Graphical representation of LDA</h6>
			<p>The most straightforward way to build the formula representing the LDA solution is through a graphical representation. This particular representation is referred to as a plate notation graphical model, as it uses plates to represent the two iterative steps in the process. You will recall that the generative process was executed for every document in the corpus, so the outermost plate, labeled M, represents iterating over each document. Similarly, the iteration over words in <em class="italics">step 3</em> is represented by the innermost plate of the diagram, labeled <em class="italics">N</em>. The circles represent the parameters, distributions, and results. The shaded circle, labeled <em class="italics">w</em>, is the selected word, which is the only known piece of data and, as such, is used to reverse-engineer the generative process. Besides <em class="italics">w</em>, the other four variables in the diagram are defined as follows:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><img alt="A picture containing scissors, tool&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_10.png"/>: Hyperparameter for the topic-document Dirichlet distribution</li>
				<li><img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_11.png"/>: Distribution of words for each topic</li>
				<li><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_12.png"/>: This is the latent variable for the topic</li>
				<li><img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_13.png"/>: This is the latent variable for the distribution of topics for each document</li>
			</ul>
			<p><img alt="A picture containing scissors, tool&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_14.png"/> and <img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_15.png"/> control the frequency of topics in documents and of words in topics. If <img alt="A picture containing scissors, tool&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_16.png"/> increases, the documents become increasingly similar as the number of topics in each document increases. On the other hand, if <img alt="A picture containing scissors, tool&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_17.png"/> decreases, the documents become increasingly dissimilar as the number of topics in each document decreases. The <img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_18.png"/> parameter behaves similarly.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-149"><a id="_idTextAnchor170"/>Variational Inference</h3>
			<p>The big issue with LDA is that the evaluation of the conditional probabilities, the distributions, is unmanageable, so instead of computing them directly, the probabilities are approximated. Variational inference is one of the simpler approximation algorithms, but it has an extensive derivation that requires significant knowledge of probability. In order to spend more time on the application of LDA, this section will give some high-level details on how variational inference is applied in this context, but will not fully explore the algorithm.</p>
			<p>Let's take a moment to work through the variational inference algorithm intuitively. Start by randomly assigning each word in each document in the corpus to one of the topics. Then, for each document and each word in each document separately, calculate two proportions. Those proportions would be the proportion of words in the document that are currently assigned to the topic, <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_19.png"/>, and the proportion of assignments across all documents of a specific word to the topic, <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_20.png"/>. Multiply the two proportions and use the resulting proportion to assign the word to a new topic. Repeat this process until a steady state, where topic assignments are not changing significantly, is reached. These assignments are then used to estimate the within-document topic mixture and the within-topic word mixture.</p>

				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.26: The variational inference process</h6>
			<p>The thought process behind variational inference is that, if the actual distribution is intractable, then a simpler distribution, let's call it the variational distribution, very close to initial distribution, which is tractable, should be found so that inference becomes possible.</p>
			<p>To start, select a family of distributions, <em class="italics">q</em>, conditioned on new variational parameters. The parameters are optimized so that the original distribution, which is actually the posterior distribution for those people familiar with Bayesian statistics, and the variational distribution are as close as possible. The variational distribution will be close enough to the original posterior distribution to be used as a proxy, making any inference done on it applicable to the original posterior distribution. The generic formula for the family of distributions, <em class="italics">q</em>, is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer262">
					<img alt="Figure 7.27: Formula for the family of distributions, q" src="image/C12626_07_27.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.27: Formula for the family of distributions, q</h6>
			<p>There is a large collection of potential variational distributions that can be used as an approximation for the posterior distribution. An initial variational distribution is selected from the collection, which acts as the starting point for an optimization process that iteratively moves closer and closer to the optimal distribution. The optimal parameters are the parameters of the distribution that best approximate the posterior.</p>
			<p>The similarity of the two distributions is measured using the <strong class="keyword">Kullback-Leibler</strong> (KL) divergence. KL divergence is also known as relative entropy. Again, finding the best variational distribution, <em class="italics">q</em>, for the original posterior distribution, <em class="italics">p</em>, requires minimizing the KL divergence. The default method for finding the parameters that minimize the divergence is the iterative fixed-point method, which we will not dig into here. </p>
			<p>Once the optimal distribution has been identified, which means the optimal parameters have been identified, it can be leveraged to produce the output matrices and do any required inference.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-150"><a id="_idTextAnchor171"/>Bag of Words</h3>
			<p>Text cannot be passed directly into any machine learning algorithm; it first needs to be encoded numerically. A straightforward way of working with text in machine learning is via a bag-of-words model, which removes all information around the order of the words and focuses strictly on the degree of presence, meaning count or frequency, of each word. The Python <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> library can be leveraged to transform the cleaned vector created in the previous exercise into the structure that the LDA model requires. Since LDA is a probabilistic model, we do not want to do any scaling or weighting of the word occurrences; instead, we opt to input just the raw counts.</p>
			<p>The input of the bag-of-words model will be the list of cleaned strings that were returned from <em class="italics">Exercise 4</em>, <em class="italics">Complete Data Cleaning</em>. The output will be the document number, the word as its numeric encoding, and the count of times that word appears in that document. These three items will be presented as a tuple and an integer. The tuple will be something like (0, 325), where 0 is the document number and 325 is the numerically encoded word. Note that 325 would be the encoding of that word across all documents. The integer would then be the count. The bag-of-words models we will be running in this chapter are from <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> and are called <strong class="inline">CountVectorizer</strong> and <strong class="inline">TfIdfVectorizer</strong>. The first model returns the raw counts and the second returns a scaled value, which we will discuss a bit later.</p>
			<p>A critical note is that the results of both topic models being covered in this chapter can vary from run to run, even when the data is the same, because of randomness. Neither the probabilities in LDA nor the optimization algorithms are deterministic, so do not be surprised if your results differ slightly from the results shown from here on out.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-151"><a id="_idTextAnchor172"/>Exercise 31: Creating a Bag-of-Words Model Using the Count Vectorizer</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we will run the <strong class="inline">CountVectorizer</strong> in <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> to convert our previously created cleaned vector of headlines into a bag-of-words data structure. In addition, we will define some variables that will be used through the modeling process.</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define <strong class="inline">number_words</strong>, <strong class="inline">number_docs</strong>, and <strong class="inline">number_features</strong>. The first two variables control the visualization of the LDA results. More to come later. The <strong class="inline">number_features</strong> variable controls the number of words that will be kept in the feature space:<p class="snippet">number_words = 10</p><p class="snippet">number_docs = 10</p><p class="snippet">number_features = 1000</p></li>
				<li>Run the count vectorizer and print the output. There are three crucial inputs, which are <strong class="inline">max_df</strong>, <strong class="inline">min_df</strong>, and <strong class="inline">max_features</strong>. These parameters further filter the number of words in the corpus down to those that will most likely influence the model. Words that only appear in a small number of documents are too rare to be attributed to any topic, so <strong class="inline">min_df</strong> is used to throw away words that appear in less than the specified number of documents. Words that appear in too many documents are not specific enough to be linked to specific topics, so <strong class="inline">max_df</strong> is used to throw away words that appear in more than the specified percentage of documents. Lastly, we do not want to overfit the model, so the number of words used to fit the model is limited to the most frequently occurring specified number (<strong class="inline">max_features</strong>) of words:<p class="snippet">vectorizer1 = sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer(</p><p class="snippet">    analyzer="word",</p><p class="snippet">    max_df=0.5, </p><p class="snippet">    min_df=20, </p><p class="snippet">    max_features=number_features</p><p class="snippet">)</p><p class="snippet">clean_vec1 = vectorizer1.fit_transform(clean_sentences)</p><p class="snippet">print(clean_vec1[0])</p><p>The output is as follows:</p><div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer263"><img alt="Figure 7.28: The bag-of-words data structure" src="image/C12626_07_28.jpg"/></div><h6>Figure 7.28: The bag-of-words data structure</h6></li>
				<li>Extract the feature names and the words from the vectorizer.

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-152"><a id="_idTextAnchor173"/>Perplexity</h3>
			<p>Models generally have metrics that can be leveraged to evaluate their performance. Topic models are no different, although performance in this case has a slightly different definition. In regression and classification, predicted values can be compared to actual values from which clear measures of performance can be calculated. With topic models, prediction is less reliable, because the model only knows the words it was trained on and new documents may not contain any of those words, despite featuring the same topics. Due to that difference, topic models are evaluated using a metric specific to language models called <strong class="keyword">perplexity</strong>. Perplexity, abbreviated to PP, measures the number of different equally most probable words that can follow any given word on average. Let's consider two words as an example: the and announce. The word the can preface an enormous number of equally most probable words, while the number of equally most probable words that can follow the word announce is significantly less – albeit still a large number. </p>
			<p>The idea is that words that, on average, can be followed by a smaller number of equally most probable words are more specific and can be more tightly tied to topics. As such, lower perplexity scores imply better language models. Perplexity is very similar to entropy, but perplexity is typically used because it is easier to interpret. As we will see momentarily, it can be used to select the optimal number of topics. With <em class="italics">m</em> being the number of words in the sequence of words, perplexity is defined as:</p>

			<p>As stated previously, LDA has two required inputs. The first are the documents themselves and the second is the number of topics. Selecting an appropriate number of topics can be very tricky. One approach to finding the optimal number of topics is to search over several numbers of topics and select the number of topics that corresponds to the smallest perplexity score. In machine learning, this approach is referred to as grid search. </p>
			<p>In this exercise, we use the perplexity scores for LDA models fit on varying numbers of topics to determine the number of topics with which to move forward. Keep in mind that the original dataset had the headlines sorted into four topics. Let's see whether this approach returns four topics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Define a function that fits an LDA model on various numbers of topics and computes the perplexity score.

				<li>Plot the perplexity scores as a function of the number of topics.

			<p>As the data frame and plot show, the optimal number of topics using perplexity is three. Having the number of topics set to four yielded the second-lowest perplexity, so, while the results did not exactly match with the information contained in the original dataset, the results are close enough to engender confidence in the grid search approach to identifying the optimal number of topics. There could be several reasons that the grid search returned three instead of four, which we will dig into in future exercises.</p>

			<p>The results of the word-topic data frame show that the abstract topics are Barack Obama, the economy, and Microsoft. What is interesting is that the word grouping describing the economy contains references to Palestine. All four topics specified in the original dataset are represented in the word-topic data frame output, but not in the fully distinct manner expected. We could be facing one of two problems. First, the topic referencing both the economy and Palestine could be under-cooked, which means increasing the number of topics may fix the issue. The other potential problem is that LDA does not handle correlated topics well. In <em class="italics">Exercise 35</em>, <em class="italics">Trying Four Topics</em>, we will try expanding the number of topics, which will give us a better idea of why one of the word groupings is seemingly a mixture of topics.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-155"><a id="_idTextAnchor177"/>Exercise 34: Visualize LDA</h3>
			<p>Visualization is a helpful tool for exploring the results of topic models. In this exercise, we will look at three different visualizations. Those visualizations are basic histograms and specialty visualizations using t-SNE and PCA.</p>
			<p>To create some of the visualizations, we are going to use the <strong class="inline">pyLDAvis</strong> Library. This library is flexible enough to take in topic models built using several different frameworks. In this case, we will use the <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> framework. This visualization tool returns a histogram showing the words that are the most closely related to each topic and a biplot, frequently used in PCA, where each circle corresponds to a topic. From the biplot, we know how prevalent each topic is across the whole corpus, which is reflected by the area of the circle, and the similarity of the topics, which is reflected by the closeness of the circles. The ideal scenario is to have the circles spread throughout the plot and be of reasonable size. That is, we want the topics to be distinct and to appear consistently across the corpus:</p>
			<ol>
				<li value="1">Run and display <strong class="inline">pyLDAvis</strong>. This plot is interactive. Clicking on each circle updates the histogram to show the top words related to that specific topic.

There are tens of thousands of headlines and any plot incorporating all the headlines is going to be difficult to read and therefore not helpful. So, this function only plots a document if one of the distribution values is greater than or equal to the input threshold value. Once the data is filtered down, we run t-SNE, where the number of components is two, so we can plot the results in two dimensions. Then, create a vector with an indicator of which topic is most related to each document. This vector will be used to color-code the plot by topic. To understand the distribution of topics across the corpus and the impact of threshold filtering, the function returns the length of the topic vector as well as the topics themselves with the number of documents to which that topic has the largest distribution value. The last step of the function is to create and return the plot.</p></li>

The t-SNE plot shows clear clusters supporting the separation between the circles represented in the biplot. The only glaring issue, which was previously discussed, is that one of the topics has words that do not seem to belong to that topic. In the next exercise, let's rerun the LDA using four topics.</p>

			<p>Looking at the word-topic table, we see that the four topics found by this model align with the four topics specified in the original dataset. Those topics are Barack Obama, Palestine, Microsoft, and the economy. The question now is, why did the model built using four topics have a higher perplexity score than the model with three topics? That answer comes from the visualization produced in <em class="italics">step 5</em>. The biplot has circles of reasonable size, but two of those circles are quite close together, which suggests that those two topics, Microsoft and the economy, are very similar. In this case, the similarity actually makes intuitive sense. Microsoft is a major global company that impacts and is impacted by the economy. A next step, if we were to make one, would be to run the t-SNE plot to check whether the clusters in the t-SNE plot overlap. Let's now apply our knowledge of LDA to another dataset.</p>

Term Frequency – Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is similar to the count vectorizer used in the LDA algorithm, except that instead of returning raw counts, TF-IDF returns a weight that reflects the importance of a given word to a document in the corpus. The key component of this weighting scheme is that there is a normalization component for how frequently a given word appears across the entire corpus. Consider the word have. </p>
			<p>The word have may occur several times in a single document, suggesting that it could be important for isolating the topic of that document, but have will occur in many documents, if not most, in the corpus, potentially rendering it unless for isolating topics. Essentially, this scheme goes one step further than just returning the raw counts of the words in the document in an effort to initially identify words that may help identify abstract topics. The TF-IDF vectorizer is executed using <strong class="inline">sklearn</strong> via <strong class="inline">TfidfVectorizer</strong>. </p>

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-160"><a id="_idTextAnchor182"/>Non-Negative Matrix Factorization</h2>
			<p>Unlike LDA, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is not a probabilistic model. It is instead, as the name implies, an approach involving linear algebra. Using matrix factorization as an approach to topic modeling was introduced by Daniel D. Lee and H. Sebastian Seung in 1999. The approach falls into the decomposition family of models that includes PCA, the modeling technique introduced in <em class="italics">Chapter 4</em>, <em class="italics">An Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction &amp; PCA</em>.</p>
			<p>The major differences between PCA and NMF are that PCA requires components to be orthogonal while allowing them to be either positive or negative. NMF requires matrix components be non-negative, which should make sense if you think of this requirement in the context of the data. Topics cannot be negatively related to documents and words cannot be negatively related to topics. If you are not convinced, try to interpret a negative weight associating a topic with a document. It would be something like, topic T makes up -30% of document D; but what does that even mean? It is nonsensical, so NMF has non-negative requirements for every part of matrix factorization.</p>
			<p>Let's define the matrix to be factorized, call it <em class="italics">X</em>, as a term-document matrix where the rows are words and the columns are documents. Each element of matrix X is either the number of occurrences of word <em class="italics">i</em> (the <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_21.png"/> row) in document <em class="italics">j</em> (the <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_22.png"/> column) or some other quantification of the relationship between word i and document j. The matrix, X, is naturally a sparse matrix as most elements in the term-document matrix will be zero, since each document only contains a limited number of words. There will be more on creating this matrix and deriving the quantifications later:</p>
			<div>

					<img alt="Figure 7.45: The matrix factorization " src="image/C12626_07_45.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.45: The matrix factorization </h6>
			<p>The matrix factorization takes the form <img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_23.png"/>, where the two component matrices, <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em>, represent the topics as collections of words and the topic weights for each document, respectively. More specifically, <img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_24.png"/> is a word by topic matrix, <img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_25.png"/> is a topic by document matrix, and, as stated earlier, <img alt="A picture containing furniture&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_26.png"/> is a word by document matrix. A nice way to think of this factorization is as a weighted sum of word groupings defining abstract topics. The equivalency symbol in the formula for the matrix factorization is an indicator that the factorization <em class="italics">WH</em> is an approximation and thus the product of those two matrices will not reproduce the original term-document matrix exactly. The goal, as it was with LDA, is to find the approximation that is closest to the original matrix. Like X, both <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em> are sparse matrices as each topic is only related to a few words and each document is a mixture of only a small number of topics – one topic in many cases.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-161"><a id="_idTextAnchor183"/>Frobenius Norm</h3>
			<p>The goal of solving NMF is the same as that of LDA: find the best approximation. To measure the distance between the input matrix and the approximation, NMF can use virtually any distance measure, but the standard is the Frobenius norm, also known as the Euclidean norm. The Frobenius norm is the sum of the element-wise squared errors mathematically expressed as <img alt="A picture containing object&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_27.png"/>.</p>
			<p>With the measure of distance selected, the next step is defining the objective function. The minimization of the Frobenius norm will return the best approximation of the original term-document matrix and thus the most reasonable topics. Note that the objective function is minimized with respect to <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em> so that both matrices are non-negative. It is expressed as <img alt="A picture containing object&#10;&#10;Description automatically generated" src="image/C12626_07_Formula_28.png"/>.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-162"><a id="_idTextAnchor184"/>Multiplicative Update</h3>
			<p>The optimization algorithm used to solve NMF by Lee and Seung in their 1999 paper is the Multiplicative Update algorithm and it is still one of the most commonly used solutions. It will be implemented in the exercises and activities later in the chapter. The update rules, for both <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em>, are derived by expanding the objective function and taking the partial derivatives with respect to <em class="italics">W</em> and<em class="italics"> H</em>. The derivatives are not difficult but do require fairly extensive linear algebra knowledge and are time-consuming, so let's skip the derivatives and just state the updates. Note that, in the update rules, <em class="italics">i </em> is the current iteration and <em class="italics">T</em> means the transpose of the matrix. The first update rule is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer289">
					<img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_46.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.46: First update rule</h6>
			<p>The second update rule is as follows:</p>
			<div>
				<div class="IMG---Figure" id="_idContainer290">
					<img alt="" src="image/C12626_07_47.jpg"/>
				</div>
			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.47: Second update rule</h6>
			<p><em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em> are updated iteratively until the algorithm converges. The objective function can also be shown to be non-increasing. That is, with each iterative update of <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em>, the objective function gets closer to the minimum. Note that the multiplicative update optimizer, if the update rules are reorganized, is a rescaled gradient descent algorithm. </p>
			<p>The final component of building a successful NMF algorithm is initializing the <em class="italics">W</em> and <em class="italics">H</em> component matrices so that the multiplicative update works quickly. A popular approach to initializing matrices is Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), which is a generalization of Eigen decomposition. In the implementation of NMF done in the forthcoming exercises, the matrices are initialized via non-negative Double Singular Value Decomposition, which is basically a more advanced version of SVD that is strictly non-negative. The full details of these initialization algorithms are not important to understanding NMF. Just note that initialization algorithms are used as a starting point for the optimization algorithms and can drastically speed up convergence.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-163"><a id="_idTextAnchor185"/>Exercise 37: Non-negative Matrix Factorization</h3>
			<p>In this exercise, we fit the NMF algorithm and output the same two result tables we did with LDA previously. Those tables are the word-topic table, which shows the top-10 words associated with each topic, and the document-topic table, which shows the top-10 documents associated with each topic. There are two additional parameters in the NMF algorithm function that we have not previously discussed, which are <strong class="inline">alpha</strong> and <strong class="inline">l1_ratio</strong>. If an overfit model is of concern, these parameters control how (<strong class="inline">l1_ratio</strong>) and the extent to which (<strong class="inline">alpha</strong>) regularization is applied to the objective function. More details can be found in the documentation for the scikit-learn library (<a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html">https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.decomposition.NMF.html</a>):</p>

			<h6>Figure 7.50: The document-topic table containing probabilities</h6>
			<p>The word-topic table contains word groupings that suggest the same abstract topics that the four-topic LDA model produced in <em class="italics">Exercise 35</em>, <em class="italics">Trying four topics</em>. However, the interesting part of the comparison is that some of the individual words contained in these groupings are new or in a new place in the grouping. This is not surprising given that the methodologies are distinct. Given the alignment with the topics specified in the original dataset, we have shown that both of these methodologies are effective tools for extracting the underlying topic structure of the corpus.</p>
			<h3 id="_idParaDest-164"><a id="_idTextAnchor186"/>Exercise 38: Visualizing NMF</h3>
			<p>The purpose of this exercise is to visualize the results of NMF. Visualizing the results gives insights into the distinctness of the topics and the prevalence of each topic in the corpus.

			</div>
			<h6>Figure 7.52: t-SNE plot with metrics summarizing the topic distribution across the corpus</h6>
			<p>The t-SNE plot, with no threshold specified, shows some topic overlap and a clear discrepancy in the topic frequency across the corpus. These two facts explain why, when using perplexity, the optimal number of topics is three. There seems to be some correlation between topics that the model can't fully accommodate. Even with the correlation between topics, the model is finding the topics it should when the number of topics is set to four.</p>
			<p>To recap, NMF is a non-probabilistic topic model that seeks to answer the same question LDA is trying to answer. It uses a popular concept of linear algebra known as matrix factorization, which is the process of breaking a large and intractable matrix down into smaller and more easily interpretable matrices that can be leveraged to answer many questions about the data. Remember that the non-negative requirement is not rooted in mathematics, but in the data itself. It does not make sense for the components of any documents to be negative. In many cases, NMF does not perform as well as LDA, because LDA incorporates prior distributions that add an extra layer of information to help inform the topic word groupings. However, we know that there are cases, especially when the topics are highly correlated, when NMF is the better performer. One of those cases was the headline data on which all the exercises were based.</p>

			<p>This activity is the summation of the topic modeling analysis done on the health Twitter data loaded and cleaned in activity one, and on which LDA was done in activity two.

			<h2 id="_idParaDest-166"><a id="_idTextAnchor188"/>Summary</h2>
			<p>When faced with the task of extracting information from an as yet unseen large collection of documents, topic modeling is a great approach, as it provides insights into the underlying structure of the documents. That is, topic models find word groupings using proximity, not context. In this chapter, we have learned how to apply two of the most common and most effective topic modeling algorithms: latent Dirichlet allocation and non-negative matrix factorization. We should now feel comfortable cleaning raw text documents using several different techniques; techniques that can be utilized in many other modeling scenarios. We continued by learning how to convert the cleaned corpus into the appropriate data structure of per-document raw word counts or word weights by applying bag-of-words models. The main focus of the chapter was fitting the two topic models, including optimizing the number of topics, converting the output to easy-to-interpret tables, and visualizing the results. With this information, you should be able to apply fully functioning topic models to derive value and insights for your business.</p>
