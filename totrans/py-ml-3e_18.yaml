    learning to tackle problems encountered with these types of machine learning.
    As you'll recall, supervised learning focuses on predicting a category label or
    continuous value from a given input feature vector. Unsupervised learning focuses
    on extracting patterns from data, making it useful for data compression (*Chapter
    5*, *Compressing Data via Dimensionality Reduction*), clustering (*Chapter 11*,
    *Working with Unlabeled Data – Clustering Analysis*), or approximating the training

    learning. Recall that in *supervised* learning, we rely on labeled training examples,
    which are provided by a supervisor or a human expert, and the goal is to train
    a model that can generalize well to unseen, unlabeled test examples. This means
    that the supervised learning model should learn to assign the same labels or values
    to a given input example as the supervisor human expert. On the other hand, in
    *unsupervised* learning, the goal is to learn or capture the underlying structure
    of a dataset, such as in clustering and dimensionality reduction methods; or learning
    how to generate new, synthetic training examples with a similar underlying distribution.
    RL is substantially different from supervised and unsupervised learning, and so
    RL is often regarded as the "third category of machine learning."
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The key element that distinguishes RL from other subtasks of machine learning,
    such as supervised and unsupervised learning, is that RL is centered around the
    concept of *learning by interaction*. This means that in RL, the model learns
    from interactions with an environment to maximize a *reward function*.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: While maximizing a reward function is related to the concept of minimizing the
    cost function in supervised learning, the *correct* labels for learning a series
    of actions are not known or defined upfront in RL—instead, they need to be learned
    through interactions with the environment, in order to achieve a certain desired
    outcome—such as winning at a game. With RL, the model (also called an **agent**)
    interacts with its environment, and by doing so generates a sequence of interactions
    that are together called an *episode*. Through these interactions, the agent collects
    a series of rewards determined by the environment. These rewards can be positive
    or negative, and sometimes they are not disclosed to the agent until the end of
    an episode.

- en: For example, imagine that we want to teach a computer to play the game of chess
    and win against human players. The labels (rewards) for each individual chess
    move made by the computer are not known until the end of the game, because during
    the game itself, we don't know whether a particular move will result in winning
    or losing that game. Only right at the end of the game is the feedback determined.
    That feedback would likely be a positive reward given if the computer won the
    game, because the agent had achieved the overall desired outcome; and vice versa,
    a negative reward would likely be given if the computer had lost the game.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, considering the example of playing chess, the input is the current
    configuration, for instance, the arrangement of the individual chess pieces on
    the board. Given the large number of possible inputs (the states of the system),
    it is impossible to label each configuration or state as positive or negative.
    Therefore, to define a learning process, we provide rewards (or penalties) at
    the end of each game, when we know whether we reached the desired outcome—whether
    we won the game or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the essence of RL. In RL, we cannot or do not teach an agent, computer
    or robot, *how* to do things; we can only specify *what* we want the agent to
    achieve. Then, based on the outcome of a particular trial, we can determine rewards
    depending on the agent's success or failure. This makes RL very attractive for
    decision making in complex environments—especially when the problem-solving task
    requires a series of steps, which are unknown, or are hard to explain, or hard
    to define.

- en: Besides applications in games and robotics, examples of RL can also be found
    in nature. For example, training a dog involves RL—we hand out rewards (treats)
    to the dog when it performs certain desirable actions. Or consider a medical dog
    that is trained to warn its partner of an oncoming seizure. In this case, we do
    not know the exact mechanism by which the dog is able to detect an oncoming seizure,
    and we certainly wouldn't be able to define a series of steps to learn seizure
    detection, even if we had precise knowledge of this mechanism. However, we can
    reward the dog with a treat if it successfully detects a seizure to *reinforce*
    this behavior!

    in order to achieve a certain goal, please do keep in mind that RL is still a
    relatively young and active area of research with many unresolved challenges.
    One aspect that makes training RL models particularly challenging is that the
    consequent model inputs depend on actions taken previously. This can lead to all
    sorts of problems, and usually results in unstable learning behavior. Also, this
    sequence-dependence in RL creates a so-called *delayed effect*, which means that
    the action taken at a time step *t* may result in a future reward appearing some
    arbitrary number of steps later.

    as a consequence of taking an action, the agent receives observations and a reward
    signal as governed by the environment. The **environment** is anything that falls

    reward depends on the given task or problem. For example, in the game of chess,
    the reward would be determined after a full game based on the outcome of all the
    moves: a win or a loss. On the other hand, we could define a maze such that the
    reward is determined after each time step. In such a maze, the agent then tries
    to maximize its accumulated rewards over its lifetime—where lifetime describes

    this concept, let's consider a very simple example where a new computer science
    graduate with a focus on software engineering is wondering whether to start working
    at a company (exploitation) or to pursue a Master's or Ph.D. degree to learn more
    about data science and machine learning (exploration). In general, exploitation
    will result in choosing actions with a greater short-term reward, whereas exploration
    can potentially result in greater total rewards in the long run. The tradeoff
    between exploration and exploitation has been studied extensively, and yet, there
    is no universal answer to this decision-making dilemma.

    breaking them down into smaller subproblems.

    receives when performing an action to transition from one state to the next. However,

    **return** and will likely yield a high reward given a particular policy.
  prefs: []

    may only be given at the end of the game if the computer wins the game. There
    is no (positive) reward if the computer loses the game. Now, imagine the computer
    performs a particular chess move that captures the opponent's queen without any
    negative consequences for the computer. Since the computer only receives a reward
    for winning the game, it does not get an immediate reward by making this move
    that captures the opponent's queen. However, the new state (the state of the board
    after capturing the queen) may have a **high value**, which may yield a reward
    (if the game is won afterward). Intuitively, we can say that the high value associated
    with capturing the opponent's queen is associated with the fact that capturing
    the queen often results in winning the game—and thus the high expected return,
    or value. However, note that capturing the opponent's queen does not always lead
    to winning the game; hence, the agent is likely to receive a positive reward,

    Overall, the main approach is very similar to the tabular Q-learning method. The
    main difference is that we now have a multilayer NN that computes the action values.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this section, we describe the procedure for training a DQN model using the
    Q-learning algorithm. The deep Q-learning approach requires us to make some modifications
    to our previously implemented standard Q-learning approach.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One such modification is in the agent's `choose_action()` method, which in the
    code of the previous section for Q-learning was simply accessing the action values
    stored in a dictionary. Now this function should be changed to perform a forward
    pass of the NN model for computing the action values.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other modifications needed for the deep Q-learning algorithm are described
    in the following two subsections.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the previous tabular method for Q-learning, we could update the values
    for specific state-action pairs without affecting the values of others. However,
    now that we approximate *q*(*s*, *a*) with an NN model, updating the weights for
    a state-action pair will likely affect the output of other states as well. When
    training NNs using stochastic gradient descent for a supervised task (for example,
    a classification task), we use multiple epochs to iterate through the training
    data multiple times until it converges.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is not feasible in Q-learning, since the episodes will change during the
    training and as a result, some states that were visited in the early stages of
    training will become less likely to be visited later.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Furthermore, another problem is that when we train an NN, we assume that the
    training examples are **IID** (**independent and identically distributed**). However,
    the samples taken from an episode of the agent are not IID, as they obviously
    form a sequence of transitions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To solve these issues, as the agent interacts with the environment and generates
    a transition quintuple ![](img/B13208_18_189.png), we store a large (but finite)
    number of such transitions in a memory buffer, often called *replay memory*. After
    each new interaction (that is, the agent selects an action and executes it in
    the environment), the resulting new transition quintuple is appended to the memory.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'To keep the size of the memory bounded, the oldest transition will be removed
    from the memory (for example, if it is a Python list, we can use the `pop(0)`
    method to remove the first element of the list). Then, a mini-batch of examples
    is randomly selected from the memory buffer, which will be used for computing
    the loss and updating the network parameters. The following figure illustrates
    the process:'

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The replay memory can be implemented using a Python list, where every time we
    add a new element to the list, we need to check the size of the list and call
    `pop(0)` if needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Alternatively, we can use the `deque` data structure from the Python `collections`
    library, which allows us to specify an optional argument, `max_len`. By specifying
    the `max_len` argument, we will have a bounded deque. Therefore, when the object
    is full, appending a new element results in automatically removing an element
    from it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Note that this is more efficient than using a Python list, since removing the
    first element of a list using `pop(0)` has O(n) complexity, while the deque's
    runtime complexity is O(1). You can learn more about the deque implementation
    from the official documentation that is available at

    update rule for training the DQN model parameters. Recall that a transition quintuple,
    *T*, stored in the batch of examples, contains ![](img/B13208_18_191.png).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    The first forward pass uses the features of the current state (![](img/B13208_18_192.png)).
    Then, the second forward pass uses the features of the next state (![](img/B13208_18_193.png)).
    As a result, we will obtain the estimated action values, ![](img/B13208_18_194.png)
    and ![](img/B13208_18_195.png), from the first and second forward pass, respectively.
    (Here, this ![](img/B13208_18_196.png) notation means a vector of Q-values for
    all actions in ![](img/B13208_18_197.png).) From the transition quintuple, we
    know that action *a* is selected by the agent.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'Therefore, according to the Q-learning algorithm, we need to update the action
    value corresponding to the state-action pair ![](img/B13208_18_198.png) with the
    scalar target value ![](img/B13208_18_199.png). Instead of forming a scalar target
    value, we will create a target action-value vector that retains the action values
    for other actions, ![](img/B13208_18_200.png), as shown in the following figure:'
