- en: 'Generally, if you are trying to automate or replicate an existing process,
    the problem is a supervised learning problem. Supervised learning techniques are
    both very useful and powerful, and you may have come across them or even helped
    create labeled datasets for them without realizing. As an example, a few years
    ago, Facebook introduced the ability to tag your friends in any image uploaded
    to the platform. To tag a friend, you would draw a square over your friend''s
    face and then add the name of your friend to notify them of the image. Fast-forward
    to today and Facebook will automatically identify your friends in the image and
    tag them for you. This is yet another example of supervised learning. If you ever
    used the early tagging system and manually identified your friends in an image,
    you were in fact helping to create Facebook''s labeled dataset. A user who uploaded
    an image of a person''s face (the input data) and tagged the photo with the subject''s
    name would then create the label for the dataset. As users continued to use this
    tagging service, a sufficiently large labeled dataset was created for the supervised
    learning problem. Now friend-tagging is completed automatically by Facebook, replacing
    the manual process with a supervised learning algorithm, as opposed to manual
    user input:'

    会自动识别图片中的朋友并为你标记他们。这又是一个监督学习的例子。如果你曾经使用过早期的标记系统，并手动在图片中标记你的朋友，实际上你是在帮助创建 Facebook
    的标注数据集。用户上传一个人的面部图片（输入数据），并用该人物的名字标记照片，这样就为数据集创建了标签。随着用户持续使用这个标记服务，一个足够大的标注数据集就被创建出来，解决了监督学习问题。现在，Facebook
    自动完成朋友标记，使用监督学习算法替代了手动输入的过程：

- en: Clustering analysis is a common form of unsupervised learning where a dataset
    is to be divided into a specified number of different groups based on the clustering
    process being used. In the case of k-nearest neighbors clustering, each sample
    from the dataset is labeled or classified in accordance with the majority vote
    of the k-closest points to the sample. As there are no manually identified labels,
    the performance of unsupervised algorithms can vary greatly with the data being
    used, as well as the selected parameters of the model. For example, should we
    use the 5 closest or 10 closest points in the majority vote of the k-closest points?
    The lack of known and target outputs during training leads to unsupervised methods
    being commonly used in exploratory analysis or in scenarios where the ground truth
    targets are somewhat ambiguous and are better defined by the constraints of the

    method is to open Jupyter using the `Anaconda` folder of the Windows Start menu.
    Click on the `http://localhost:8888`, and will start in a default folder path.

    and useful Python package. It is also a great package to start with as, obviously,
    we cannot analyze any data if we do not first load it into the system. As pandas
    provides so much functionality, one very important skill in using the package
    is the ability to read and understand the documentation. Even after years of experience
    programming in Python and using pandas, we still refer to the documentation very
    frequently. The functionality within the API is so extensive that it is impossible
    to memorize all of the features and specifics of the implementation.

    or [https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Applied-Supervised-Learning-with-Python](https://github.com/TrainingByPackt/Applied-Supervised-Learning-with-Python),
    which contains a roll of the guests on board the Titanic as well as their age,
    survival status, and number of siblings/parents. Before we get started with loading
    the data into Python, it is critical that we spend some time looking over the
    information provided for the dataset so that we can have a thorough understanding
    of what it contains. Download the dataset and place it in the directory you''re
    working in.'

    This simple command provides us with a lot of useful information; looking at the
    values for `count` (which counts the number of valid samples), we can see that
    there are 1,046 valid samples in the `Age` category, but 1,308 in `Fare`, and
    only 891 in `Survived`. We can see that the youngest person was 0.17 years, the
    average age is 29.898, and the eldest 80\. The minimum fare was £0, with £33.30
    the average and £512.33 the most expensive. If we look at the `Survived` column,
    we have 891 valid samples, with a mean of 0.38, which means about 38% survived.

- en: The ultimate goal of this supervised learning problem is to predict the survival
    of passengers on the Titanic given the information we have available. So, that
    means that the `Survived` column provides our labels for training. What are we
    going to do if we are missing 418 of the labels? If this was a project where we
    had control over the collection of the data and access to its origins, we would
    obviously correct this by recollecting or asking for the labels to be clarified.
    With the Titanic dataset, we do not have this ability so we must make another
    educated judgement call. We could try some unsupervised learning techniques to
    see whether there are some patterns in the survival information that we could
    use. However, we may not have a choice of simply ignoring these rows. The task
    is to predict whether a person survived or perished, not whether they may have
    survived. By estimating the ground truth labels, we may introduce significant
    noise into the dataset, reducing our ability to accurately predict survival.

    our model could be significantly reduced as, during training, the model would
    simply need to guess that the person did not survive to be correct 61% (*549 /
    (549 + 342)*) of the time. If, in reality, the actual survival rate was, say,
    50%, then when being applied to unseen data, our model would predict not survived

- en: There are a few options available for managing class imbalance, one of which,
    similar to the missing data scenario, is to randomly remove samples from the over-represented
    class until balance has been achieved. Again, this option is not ideal, or perhaps
    even appropriate, as it involves ignoring available data. A more constructive
    example may be to oversample the under-represented class by randomly copying samples
    from the under-represented class in the dataset to boost the number of samples.
    While removing data can lead to accuracy issues due to discarding useful information,
    oversampling the under-represented class can lead to being unable to predict the
    label of unseen data, also known as overfitting (which we will cover in *Chapter
    5*, *Ensemble Modeling*).

    to copy more data into a DataFrame using the `append` method, which works in a

    of statistics. As such, the principles of confidence and sample size can also
    be applied to understand the issues with a small dataset. Recall that if we were
    to take measurements from a data source with high variance, then the degree of
    uncertainty in the measurements would also be high and more samples would be required
    to achieve a specified confidence in the value of the mean. The sample principles
    can be applied to machine learning datasets. Those datasets with a variance in
    the features with the most predictive power generally require more samples for
    reasonable performance as more confidence is also required.
