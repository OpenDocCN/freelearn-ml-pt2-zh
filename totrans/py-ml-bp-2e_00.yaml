- en: Machine learning is transforming the way we understand and interact with the
    world around us. This book is the perfect guide for you to put your knowledge
    and skills into practice and use the Python ecosystem to cover the key domains
    in machine learning. This second edition covers a range of libraries from the
    Python ecosystem, including TensorFlow and Keras, to help you implement real-world
    machine learning projects.

- en: The book begins by giving you an overview of machine learning with Python. With
    the help of complex datasets and optimized techniques, you'll learn how to apply
    advanced concepts and popular machine learning algorithms to real-world projects.
    Next, you'll cover projects in domains such as predictive analytics to analyze
    the stock market, and recommendation systems for GitHub repositories. In addition
    to this, you'll also work on projects from the NLP domain to create a custom news
    feed using frameworks such as scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and Keras. Following this,
    you'll learn how to build an advanced chatbot, and scale things up using PySpark.
    In the concluding chapters, you can look forward to exciting insights into deep
    learning and even create an application using computer vision and neural networks.
