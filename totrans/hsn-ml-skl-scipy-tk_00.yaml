- en: You have already seen *Harvard Business Review* describing data science as the
    *sexiest job of the 21^(st) century*. You have been watching terms such as *machine
    learning* and *artificial intelligence* pop up around you in the news all the
    time. You aspire to join this league of machine learning data scientists soon.
    Or maybe, you are already in the field but want to take your career to the next
    level. You want to learn more about the underlying statistical and mathematical
    theory, and apply this new knowledge using the most commonly used tool among practitioners,
    scikit-learn.

- en: This book is here for you. It begins with an explanation of machine learning
    concepts and fundamentals and strikes a balance between theoretical concepts and
    their applications. Each chapter covers a different set of algorithms and shows
    you how to use them to solve real-life problems. You'll also learn various key
    supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms using practical examples.
    Whether it is an instance-based learning algorithm, Bayesian estimation, a deep
    neural network, a tree-based ensemble, or a recommendation system, you'll gain
    a thorough understanding of its theory and learn when to apply it to real-life
    problems.

    to your toolbox. You will augment scikit-learn with other tools such as pandas,
    Matplotlib, imbalanced-learn, and scikit-surprise. By the end of this book, you
    will be able to orchestrate these tools together to take a data-driven approach
    to providing end-to-end machine learning solutions.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for machine learning data scientists who want to master the theoretical
    and practical sides of machine learning algorithms and understand how to use them
    to solve real-life problems. Working knowledge of Python and a basic understanding
    of underlying mathematical and statistical concepts is required. Nevertheless,
    this book will walk you through the new concepts to cater to both new and experienced
    data scientists.

    set up a virtual environment to install the required libraries into. It's up to
    you whether you wish to use Python's `venv` module, the virtual environment provided
    by Anaconda, or any other option you like. I'll be using `pip` to install the
    libraries needed in the book, but once more, it is up to you whether you prefer
    to use `conda` or any other alternatives.

    to get started. I will show you how to install them using the same versions tested
    here, so we are both on the same page throughout the rest of this book. Whenever
    we need to install any additional libraries in the later chapters, I will also
    explain how to set them up.

    graphs. I recommend that you also go to the Project Jupyter site and install Jupyter
    Notebook or Jupyter Lab. This setup is usually recommended when running experimental
    code. It helps you cut your code into pieces, iterate on each part separately,
    and display the resulting graphs alongside the code. When it comes to writing
    production code, then you may use your favorite **integrated development environment**
    (**IDE**) instead.

    expect the code here to run on any other operating system, whether it is Microsoft
    Windows or any one of the different Linux distributions. It is more common for
    machine learning algorithms to hit a memory limitation before hitting a CPU bottleneck.
    Nevertheless, for most of the code and the datasets used here, I would expect
    computers with less memory than mine to still work fine.
