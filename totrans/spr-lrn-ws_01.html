		<h4 class="style2">Overview</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">This chapter introduces you to supervised learning, using Anaconda to manage coding environments, and using Jupyter notebooks to create, manage, and run code. It also covers some of the most common Python packages used in supervised learning: pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn. By the end of this chapter, you will be able to install and load Python libraries into your development environment for use in analysis and machine learning problems. You will also be able to load an external data source using pandas, and use a variety of methods to search, filter, and compute descriptive statistics of the data. This chapter will enable you to gauge the potential impact of various issues such as missing data, class imbalance, and low sample size within the data source.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Introduction</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The study and application of machine learning and artificial intelligence has recently been the source of much interest and research in the technology and business communities. Advanced data analytics and machine learning techniques have shown great promise in advancing many sectors, such as personalized healthcare and self-driving cars, as well as in solving some of the world's greatest challenges, such as combating climate change (see Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05433.pdf).</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">This book has been designed to help you to take advantage of the unique confluence of events in the field of data science and machine learning today. Across the globe, private enterprises and governments are realizing the value and efficiency of data-driven products and services. At the same time, reduced hardware costs and open source software solutions are significantly reducing the barriers to entry of learning and applying machine learning techniques.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Here, we will focus on supervised machine learning (or, supervised learning for short). We'll explain the different types of machine learning shortly, but let's begin with some quick information. The now-classic example of supervised learning is developing an algorithm to distinguish between pictures of cats and dogs. The supervised part arises from two aspects; first, we have a set of pictures where we know the correct answers. We call such data labeled data. Second, we carry out a process where we iteratively test our algorithm's ability to predict "cat" or "dog" given pictures, and we make corrections to the algorithm when the predictions are incorrect. This process, at a high level, is similar to teaching children. However, it generally takes a lot more data to train an algorithm than to teach a child to recognize cats and dogs! Fortunately, there are rapidly growing sources of data at our disposal. Note the use of the words learning and train in the context of developing our algorithm. These might seem to be giving human qualities to our machines and computer programs, but they are already deeply ingrained in the machine learning (and artificial intelligence) literature, so let's use them and understand them. Training in our context here always refers to the process of providing labeled data to an algorithm and making adjustments to the algorithm to best predict the labels given the data. Supervised means that the labels for the data are provided within the training, allowing the model to learn from these labels.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Let's now understand the distinction between supervised learning and other forms of machine learning.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">When to Use Supervised Learning</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Generally, if you are trying to automate or replicate an existing process, the problem is a supervised learning problem. As an example, let's say you are the publisher of a magazine that reviews and ranks hairstyles from various time periods. Your readers frequently send you far more images of their favorite hairstyles for review than you can manually process. To save some time, you would like to automate the sorting of the hairstyle images you receive based on time periods, starting with hairstyles from the 1960s and 1980s, as you can see in the following figure:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-S9FJQL0H.jpg" alt="Figure 1.1: Images of hairstyles from different time periods&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.1: Images of hairstyles from different time periods</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">To create your hairstyles-sorting algorithm, you start by collecting a large sample of hairstyle images and manually labeling each one with its corresponding time period. Such a dataset (known as a labeled dataset) is the input data (hairstyle images) for which the desired output information (time period) is known and recorded. This type of problem is a classic supervised learning problem; we are trying to develop an algorithm that takes a set of inputs and learns to return the answers that we have told it are correct.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Python Packages and Modules</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Python is one of the most popular programming languages used for machine learning, and is the language used here.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">While the standard features that are included in Python are certainly feature-rich, the true power of Python lies in the additional libraries (also known as packages), which, thanks to open source licensing, can be easily downloaded and installed through a few simple commands. In this book, we generally assume your system has been configured using Anaconda, which is an open source environment manager for Python. Depending on your system, you can configure multiple virtual environments using Anaconda, each one configured with specific packages and even different versions of Python. Using Anaconda takes care of many of the requirements to get ready to perform machine learning, as many of the most common packages come pre-built within Anaconda. Refer to the preface for Anaconda installation instructions.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this book, we will be using the following additional Python packages:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">NumPy (pronounced Num Pie and available at https://www.numpy.org/): NumPy (short for numerical Python) is one of the core components of scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides the foundational data types from which a number of other data structures derive, including linear algebra, vectors and matrices, and key random number functionality.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">SciPy (pronounced Sigh Pie and available at https://www.scipy.org): SciPy, along with NumPy, is a core scientific computing package. SciPy provides a number of statistical tools, signal processing tools, and other functionality, such as Fourier transforms.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">pandas (available at https://pandas.pydata.org/): pandas is a high-performance library for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and manipulating data structures.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Matplotlib (available at https://matplotlib.org/): Matplotlib is the foundational Python library for creating graphs and plots of datasets and is also the base package from which other Python plotting libraries derive. The Matplotlib API has been designed in alignment with the Matlab plotting library to facilitate an easy transition to Python.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Seaborn (available at https://seaborn.pydata.org/): Seaborn is a plotting library built on top of Matplotlib, providing attractive color and line styles as well as a number of common plotting templates.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Scikit-learn (available at https://scikit-learn.org/stable/): Scikit-learn is a Python machine learning library that provides a number of data mining, modeling, and analysis techniques in a simple API. Scikit-learn includes a number of machine learning algorithms out of the box, including classification, regression, and clustering techniques.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">These packages form the foundation of a versatile machine learning development environment, with each package contributing a key set of functionalities. As discussed, by using Anaconda, you will already have all of the required packages installed and ready for use. If you require a package that is not included in the Anaconda installation, it can be installed by simply entering and executing the following code in a Jupyter notebook cell:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">!conda install &lt;package name&gt;</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">As an example, if we wanted to install Seaborn, we'd run the following command:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">!conda install seaborn</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">To use one of these packages in a notebook, all we need to do is import it:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">import matplotlib</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Loading Data in Pandas</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">pandas has the ability to read and write a number of different file formats and data structures, including CSV, JSON, and HDF5 files, as well as SQL and Python Pickle formats. The pandas input/output documentation can be found at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/io.html. We will continue to look into the pandas functionality by loading data via a CSV file.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">The dataset used in this chapter is available on our GitHub repository via the following link: https://packt.live/2vjyPK9. Once you download the entire repository on your system, you can find the dataset in the Datasets folder. Furthermore, this dataset is the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset, which was originally made available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/Titanic/data.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The dataset contains a roll of the guests on board the famous ship Titanic, as well as their age, survival status, and number of siblings/parents. Before we get started with loading the data into Python, it is critical that we spend some time looking over the information provided for the dataset so that we can have a thorough understanding of what it contains. Download the dataset and place it in the directory you're working in.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Looking at the description for the data, we can see that we have the following fields available:</p>
		<br/>
		<p>survival: This tells us whether a given person survived (0 = No, 1 = Yes).</p>
		<br/>
		<p>pclass: This is a proxy for socio-economic status, where first class is upper, second class is middle, and third class is lower status.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>sex: This tells us whether a given person is male or female.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>age: This is a fractional value if less than 1; for example, 0.25 is 3 months. If the age is estimated, it is in the form of xx.5.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>sibsp: A sibling is defined as a brother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsister, and a spouse is a husband or wife.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>parch: A parent is a mother or father, while a child is a daughter, son, stepdaughter, or stepson. Children that traveled only with a nanny did not travel with a parent. Thus, 0 was assigned for this field.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>ticket: This gives the person's ticket number.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>fare: This is the passenger's fare.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>cabin: This tells us the passenger's cabin number.</p>
		<br/>
		<p>embarked: The point of embarkation is the location where the passenger boarded the ship.</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Note that the information provided with the dataset does not give any context as to how the data was collected. The survival, pclass, and embarked fields are known as categorical variables as they are assigned to one of a fixed number of labels or categories to indicate some other information. For example, in embarked, the C label indicates that the passenger boarded the ship at Cherbourg, and the value of 1 in survival indicates they survived the sinking.</p>

		<h4 class="style0">Exercise 1.01: Loading and Summarizing the Titanic Dataset</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this exercise, we will read our Titanic dataset into Python and perform a few basic summary operations on it:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Open a new Jupyter notebook.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Import the pandas and numpy packages using shorthand notation:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">import pandas as pd</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">import numpy as np</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Open the titanic.csv file by clicking on it in the Jupyter notebook home page as shown in the following figure:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 0,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-UD4G36A4.jpg" alt="Figure 1.2: Opening the CSV file&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.2: Opening the CSV file</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The file is a CSV file, which can be thought of as a table, where each line is a row in the table and each comma separates columns in the table. Thankfully, we don't need to work with these tables in raw text form and can load them using pandas:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-4IABVFBO.jpg" alt="Figure 1.3: Contents of the CSV file&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.3: Contents of the CSV file</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">Take a moment to look up the pandas documentation for the read_csv function at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html. Note the number of different options available for loading CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In an executable Jupyter notebook cell, execute the following code to load the data from the file:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df = pd.read_csv(r'..\Datasets\titanic.csv')</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The pandas DataFrame class provides a comprehensive set of attributes and methods that can be executed on its own contents, ranging from sorting, filtering, and grouping methods to descriptive statistics, as well as plotting and conversion.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">Open and read the documentation for pandas DataFrame objects at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Read the first ten rows of data using the head() method of the DataFrame:</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">The # symbol in the code snippet below denotes a code comment. Comments are added into code to help explain specific bits of logic.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.head(10) # Examine the first 10 samples</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-A5PCLLFO.jpg" alt="Figure 1.4: Reading the first 10 rows&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.4: Reading the first 10 rows</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">To access the source code for this specific section, please refer to https://packt.live/2Ynb7sf.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">You can also run this example online at https://packt.live/2BvTRrG. You must execute the entire Notebook in order to get the desired result.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this sample, we have a visual representation of the information in the DataFrame. We can see that the data is organized in a tabular, almost spreadsheet-like structure. The different types of data are organized into columns, while each sample is organized into rows. Each row is assigned an index value and is shown as the numbers 0 to 9 in bold on the left-hand side of the DataFrame. Each column is assigned to a label or name, as shown in bold at the top of the DataFrame.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The idea of a DataFrame as a kind of spreadsheet is a reasonable analogy. As we will see in this chapter, we can sort, filter, and perform computations on the data just as you would in a spreadsheet program. While it's not covered in this chapter, it is interesting to note that DataFrames also contain pivot table functionality, just like a spreadsheet (https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.pivot_table.html).</p>

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Exercise 1.02: Indexing and Selecting Data</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Now that we have loaded some data, let's use the selection and indexing methods of the DataFrame to access some data of interest. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1.01, Loading and Summarizing the Titanic Dataset:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Select individual columns in a similar way to a regular dictionary by using the labels of the columns, as shown here:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df['Age']</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">0 22.0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">1 38.0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">2 26.0</p>
		<br/>

		<p class="style0">1308 NaN</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Name: Age, Length: 1309, dtype: float64</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">If there are no spaces in the column name, we can also use the dot operator. If there are spaces in the column names, we will need to use the bracket notation:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.Age</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">0 22.0</p>

		<p class="style0">In this exercise, we have seen how to use pandas' read_csv() function to load data into Python within a Jupyter notebook. We then explored a number of ways that pandas, by presenting the data in a DataFrame, facilitates selecting specific items in a DataFrame and viewing the contents. With these basics understood, let's look at some more advanced ways to index and select data.</p>

		<h4 class="style0">Exercise 1.03: Advanced Indexing and Selection</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">With the basics of indexing and selection under our belt, we can turn our attention to more advanced indexing and selection. In this exercise, we will look at a few important methods for performing advanced indexing and selecting data. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1.01, Loading and Summarizing the Titanic Dataset:</p>

		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this exercise, we have seen how to select data from a DataFrame using conditional operators that inspect the data and return the subsets we want. We also saw how to remove a column we didn't need (in this case, the Unnamed column simply contained row numbers that are not relevant to analysis). Now, we'll dig deeper into some of the power of pandas.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Pandas Methods</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Now that we are confident with some pandas basics, as well as some more advanced indexing and selecting tools, let's look at some other DataFrame methods. For a complete list of all methods available in a DataFrame, we can refer to the class documentation.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">The pandas documentation is available at https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">You should now know how many methods are available within a DataFrame. There are far too many to cover in detail in this chapter, so we will select a few that will give you a great start in supervised machine learning.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We have already seen the use of one method, head(), which provides the first five lines of the DataFrame. We can select more or fewer lines if we wish by providing the number of lines as an argument, as shown here:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.head(n=20) # 20 lines</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.head(n=32) # 32 lines</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Alternatively, you can use the tail() function to see a specified number of lines at the end of the DataFrame.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Another useful method is describe, which is a super-quick way of getting the descriptive statistics of the data within a DataFrame. We can see next that the sample size (count), mean, minimum, maximum, standard deviation, and the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles are returned for all columns of numerical data in the DataFrame (note that text columns have been omitted):</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.describe()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-ZLC1M3ID.jpg" alt="Figure 1.14: The describe method&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.14: The describe method</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Note that only columns of numerical data have been included within the summary. This simple command provides us with a lot of useful information; looking at the values for count (which counts the number of valid samples), we can see that there are 1,046 valid samples in the Age category, but 1,308 in Fare, and only 891 in Survived. We can see that the youngest person was 0.17 years, the average age is 29.898, and the eldest passenger was 80. The minimum fare was £0, with £33.30 the average and £512.33 the most expensive. If we look at the Survived column, we have 891 valid samples, with a mean of 0.38, which means about 38% survived.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We can also get these values separately for each of the columns by calling the respective methods of the DataFrame, as shown here:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.count()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Cabin 295</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Embarked 1307</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Fare 1308</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Pclass 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Ticket 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Age 1046</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Name 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Parch 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Sex 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">SibSp 1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Survived 891</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">dtype: int64</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">But we have some columns that contain text data, such as Embarked, Ticket, Name, and Sex. So what about these? How can we get some descriptive information for these columns? We can still use describe; we just need to pass it some more information. By default, describe will only include numerical columns and will compute the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles, but we can configure this to include text-based columns by passing the include = 'all' argument, as shown here:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.describe(include='all')</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-1ZRAJN7I.jpg" alt="Figure 1.15: The describe method with text-based columns&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.15: The describe method with text-based columns</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">That's better—now we have much more information. Looking at the Cabin column, we can see that there are 295 entries, with 186 unique values. The most common values are C32, C25, and C27, and they occur 6 times (from the freq value). Similarly, if we look at the Embarked column, we see that there are 1,307 entries, 3 unique values, and that the most commonly occurring value is S, with 914 entries.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Notice the occurrence of NaN values in our describe output table. NaN, or Not a Number, values are very important within DataFrames as they represent missing or not available data. The ability of the pandas library to read from data sources that contain missing or incomplete information is both a blessing and a curse. Many other libraries would simply fail to import or read the data file in the event of missing information, while the fact that it can be read also means that the missing data must be handled appropriately.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">When looking at the output of the describe method, you should notice that the Jupyter notebook renders it in the same way as the original DataFrame that we read in using read_csv. There is a very good reason for this, as the results returned by the describe method are themselves a pandas DataFrame and thus possess the same methods and characteristics as the data read in from the CSV file. This can be easily verified using Python's built-in type function, as in the following code:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">type(df.describe(include='all'))</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">pandas.core.frame.DataFrame</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Now that we have a summary of the dataset, let's dive in with a little more detail to get a better understanding of the available data.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">A comprehensive understanding of the available data is critical in any supervised learning problem. The source and type of the data, the means by which it is collected, and any errors potentially resulting from the collection process all have an effect on the performance of the final model.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Hopefully, by now, you are comfortable with using pandas to provide a high-level overview of the data. We will now spend some time looking into the data in greater detail.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Exercise 1.04: Using the Aggregate Method</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We have already seen how we can index or select rows or columns from a DataFrame and use advanced indexing techniques to filter the available data based on specific criteria. Another handy method that allows for such selection is the groupby method, which provides a quick method for selecting groups of data at a time and provides additional functionality through the DataFrameGroupBy object. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1.01, Loading and Summarizing the Titanic Dataset:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Use the groupby method to group the data under the Embarked column to find out how many different values for Embarked there are:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped = df.groupby('Embarked')</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">print(f'There are {len(embarked_grouped)} Embarked groups')</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There are 3 Embarked groups</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Display the output of embarked_grouped.groups to find what the groupby method actually does:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.groups</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-PM7LCIIW.jpg" alt="Figure 1.16: Output of embarked_grouped.groups&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.16: Output of embarked_grouped.groups</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We can see here that the three groups are C, Q, and S, and that embarked_grouped.groups is actually a dictionary where the keys are the groups. The values are the rows or indexes of the entries that belong to that group.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Use the iloc method to inspect row 1 and confirm that it belongs to embarked group C:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.iloc[1]</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-R9TRRNJC.jpg" alt="Figure 1.17: Inspecting row 1&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.17: Inspecting row 1</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">As the groups are a dictionary, we can iterate through them and execute computations on the individual groups. Compute the mean age for each group, as shown here:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">for name, group in embarked_grouped:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">    print(name, group.Age.mean())</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">C 32.33216981132075</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Q 28.63</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">S 29.245204603580564</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Another option is to use the aggregate method, or agg for short, and provide it with the function to apply across the columns. Use the agg method to determine the mean of each group:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.agg(np.mean)</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-0S7SC7MC.jpg" alt="Figure 1.18: Using the agg method&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.18: Using the agg method</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">So, how exactly does agg work and what type of functions can we pass it? Before we can answer these questions, we need to first consider the data type of each column in the DataFrame, as each column is passed through this function to produce the result we see here. Each DataFrame comprises a collection of columns of pandas series data, which, in many ways, operates just like a list. As such, any function that can take a list or a similar iterable and compute a single value as a result can be used with agg.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Define a simple function that returns the first value in the column and then pass that function through to agg, as an example:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">def first_val(x):</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">    return x.values[0]</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.agg(first_val)</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>

		<p class="style2">You can also run this example online at https://packt.live/2AZnq51. You must execute the entire Notebook in order to get the desired result.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this exercise, we have seen how to group data within a DataFrame, which then allows additional functions to be applied using .agg(), such as to calculate group means. These sorts of operations are extremely common in analyzing and preparing data for analysis.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Quantiles</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The previous exercise demonstrated how to find the mean. In statistical data analysis, we are also often interested in knowing the value in a dataset below or above which a certain fraction of the points lie. Such points are called quantiles. For example, if we had a sequence of numbers from 1 to 10,001, the quantile for 25% is the value 2,501. That is, at the value 2,501, 25% of our data lies below that cutoff. Quantiles are often used in data visualizations because they convey a sense of the distribution of the data. In particular, the standard boxplot in Matplotlib draws a box bounded by the first and third of 4 quantiles.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">For example, let's establish the 25% quantile of the following dataframe:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">import pandas as pd</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df = pd.DataFrame({"A":[1, 6, 9, 9]})</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">#calculate the 25% quantile over the dataframe</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.quantile(0.25, axis = 0)</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">A 4.75</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Name: 0.25, dtype: float64</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">As you can see from the preceding output, 4.75 is the 25% quantile value for the DataFrame.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">For more information on quantile methods, refer to https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/frame.html.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Later in this book, we'll use the idea of quantiles as we explore the data.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Lambda Functions</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">One common and useful way of implementing agg is through the use of Lambda functions.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Lambda, or anonymous, functions (also known as inline functions in other languages) are small, single-expression functions that can be declared and used without the need for a formal function definition via the use of the def keyword. Lambda functions are essentially provided for convenience and aren't intended to be used for extensive periods. The main benefit of Lambda functions is that they can be used in places where a function might not be appropriate or convenient, such as inside other expressions or function calls. The standard syntax for a Lambda function is as follows (always starting with the lambda keyword):</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">lambda &lt;input values&gt;: &lt;computation for values to be returned&gt;</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Let's now do an exercise and create some interesting Lambda functions.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Exercise 1.05: Creating Lambda Functions</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this exercise, we will create a Lambda function that returns the first value in a column and use it with agg. This exercise is a continuation of Exercise 1.01, Loading and Summarizing the Titanic Dataset:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Write the first_val function as a Lambda function, passed to agg:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped = df.groupby('Embarked')</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.agg(lambda x: x.values[0])</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-888JAY5N.jpg" alt="Figure 1.20: Using the agg method with a Lambda function&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.20: Using the agg method with a Lambda function</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Obviously, we get the same result, but notice how much more convenient the Lambda function was to use, especially given the fact that it is only intended to be used briefly.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We can also pass multiple functions to agg via a list to apply the functions across the dataset. Pass the Lambda function as well as the NumPy mean and standard deviation functions, like this:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.agg([lambda x: x.values[0], np.mean, np.std])</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-JXL36A0N.jpg" alt="Figure 1.21: Using the agg method with multiple Lambda functions&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.21: Using the agg method with multiple Lambda functions</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Apply numpy.sum to the Fare column and the Lambda function to the Age column by passing agg a dictionary where the keys are the columns to apply the function to, and the values are the functions themselves to be able to apply different functions to different columns in the DataFrame:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">embarked_grouped.agg({'Fare': np.sum, \</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                      'Age': lambda x: x.values[0]})</p>

		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.22: Using the agg method with a dictionary of different columns</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Finally, execute the groupby method using more than one column. Provide the method with a list of the columns (Sex and Embarked) to groupby, like this:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">age_embarked_grouped = df.groupby(['Sex', 'Embarked'])</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">age_embarked_grouped.groups</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.23: Using the groupby method with more than one column</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Similar to when the groupings were computed by just the Embarked column, we can see here that a dictionary is returned where the keys are the combination of the Sex and Embarked columns returned as a tuple. The first key-value pair in the dictionary is a tuple, ('Male', 'S'), and the values correspond to the indices of rows with that specific combination. There will be a key-value pair for each combination of unique values in the Sex and Embarked columns.</p>

		<br/>
		<p class="style0">This concludes our brief exploration of data inspection and manipulation. We now move on to one of the most important topics in data science, data quality.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Data Quality Considerations</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The quality of data used in any machine learning problem, supervised or unsupervised, is critical to the performance of the final model, and should be at the forefront when planning any machine learning project. As a simple rule of thumb, if you have clean data, in sufficient quantity, with a good correlation between the input data type and the desired output, then the specifics regarding the type and details of the selected supervised learning model become significantly less important in achieving a good result.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In reality, however, this is rarely the case. There are usually some issues regarding the quantity of available data, the quality or signal-to-noise ratio in the data, the correlation between the input and output, or some combination of all three factors. As such, we will use this last section of this chapter to consider some of the data quality problems that may occur and some mechanisms for addressing them. Previously, we mentioned that in any machine learning problem, having a thorough understanding of the dataset is critical if we are to construct a high-performing model.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">This is particularly the case when looking into data quality and attempting to address some of the issues present within the data. Without a comprehensive understanding of the dataset, additional noise or other unintended issues may be introduced during the data cleaning process, leading to further degradation of performance.</p>
		<br/>
		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">A detailed description of the Titanic dataset and the type of data included is contained in the Loading Data in pandas section. If you need a quick refresher, go back and review that section now.</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Managing Missing Data</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">As we discussed earlier, the ability of pandas to read data with missing values is both a blessing and a curse and, arguably, is the most common issue that needs to be managed before we can continue with developing our supervised learning model. The simplest, but not necessarily the most effective, method is to just remove or ignore those entries that are missing data. We can easily do this in pandas using the dropna method on the DataFrame:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">complete_data = df.dropna()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There is one very significant consequence of simply dropping rows with missing data and that is we may be throwing away a lot of important information. This is highlighted very clearly in the Titanic dataset as a lot of rows contain missing data. If we were to simply ignore these rows, we would start with a sample size of 1,309 and end with a sample of 183 entries. Developing a reasonable supervised learning model with a little over 10% of the data would be very difficult indeed. The following code displays the use of the dropna() method to handle the missing entries:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">len(df)</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The preceding input produces the following output:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">1309</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The dropna() method is implemented as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">len(df.dropna())</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The preceding input produces the following output:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">183</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">So, with the exception of the early, explorative phase, it is rarely acceptable to simply discard all rows with invalid information. We can identify which rows are actually missing information and whether the missing information is a problem unique to certain columns or is consistent throughout all columns of the dataset. We can use aggregate to help us here as well:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df.aggregate(lambda x: x.isna().sum())</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Cabin 1014</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Embarked 2</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Fare 1</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Pclass 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Ticket 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Age 263</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Name 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Parch 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Sex 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">SibSp 0</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Survived 418</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">dtype: int64</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Now, this is useful! We can see that the vast majority of missing information is in the Cabin column, some in Age, and a little more in Survived. This is one of the first times in the data cleaning process that we may need to make an educated judgment call.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">What do we want to do with the Cabin column? There is so much missing information here that, in fact, it may not be possible to use it in any reasonable way. We could attempt to recover the information by looking at the names, ages, and number of parents/siblings and see whether we can match some families together to provide information, but there would be a lot of uncertainty in this process. We could also simplify the column by using the level of the cabin on the ship rather than the exact cabin number, which may then correlate better with name, age, and social status. This is unfortunate as there could be a good correlation between Cabin and Survived, as perhaps those passengers in the lower decks of the ship may have had a harder time evacuating. We could examine only the rows with valid Cabin values to see whether there is any predictive power in the Cabin entry; but, for now, we will simply disregard Cabin as a reasonable input (or feature).</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We can see that the Embarked and Fare columns only have three missing samples between them. If we decided that we needed the Embarked and Fare columns for our model, it would be a reasonable argument to simply drop these rows. We can do this using our indexing techniques, where ~ represents the not operation, or flipping the result (that is, where df.Embarked is not NaN and df.Fare is not NaN):</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid = df.loc[(~df.Embarked.isna()) &amp; (~df.Fare.isna())]</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The missing age values are a little more interesting, as there are too many rows with missing age values to just discard them. But we also have a few more options here, as we can have a little more confidence in some plausible values to fill in. The simplest option would be to simply fill in the missing age values with the mean age for the dataset:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid[['Age']] = df_valid[['Age']]\</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                    .fillna(df_valid.Age.mean())</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">This is okay, but there are probably better ways of filling in the data rather than just giving all 263 people the same value. Remember, we are trying to clean up the data with the goal of maximizing the predictive power of the input features and the survival rate. Giving everyone the same value, while simple, doesn't seem too reasonable. What if we were to look at the average ages of the members of each of the classes (Pclass)? This may give a better estimate, as the average age reduces from class 1 through 3, as you can see in the following code:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid.loc[df.Pclass == 1, 'Age'].mean()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The preceding input produces the following output:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">37.956806510096975</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Average age for class 2 is as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid.loc[df.Pclass == 2, 'Age'].mean()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The preceding input produces the following output:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">29.52440879717283</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Average age for class 3 is as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid.loc[df.Pclass == 3, 'Age'].mean()</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The preceding input produces the following output:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">26.23396338788047</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">What if we were to consider the sex of the person as well as ticket class (social status)? Do the average ages differ here too? Let's find out:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">for name, grp in df_valid.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex']):</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">    print('%i' % name[0], name[1], '%0.2f' % grp['Age'].mean())</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">1 female 36.84</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">1 male 41.03</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">2 female 27.50</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">2 male 30.82</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">3 female 22.19</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">3 male 25.86</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We can see here that males in all ticket classes are typically older. This combination of sex and ticket class provides much more resolution than simply filling in all missing fields with the mean age. To do this, we will use the transform method, which applies a function to the contents of a series or DataFrame and returns another series or DataFrame with the transformed values. This is particularly powerful when combined with the groupby method:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">mean_ages = df_valid.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'].\</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                              transform(lambda x: \</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                              x.fillna(x.mean()))</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid.loc[:, 'Age'] = mean_ages</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There is a lot in these two lines of code, so let's break them down into components. Let's look at the first line:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">mean_ages = df_valid.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'].\</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                              transform(lambda x: \</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">                              x.fillna(x.mean()))</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We are already familiar with df_valid.groupby(['Pclass', 'Sex'])['Age'], which groups the data by ticket class and sex and returns only the Age column. The lambda x: x.fillna(x.mean()) Lambda function takes the input pandas series and fills the NaN values with the mean value of the series.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The second line assigns the filled values within mean_ages to the Age column. Note the use of the loc[:, 'Age'] indexing method, which indicates that all rows within the Age column are to be assigned the values contained within mean_ages:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_valid.loc[:, 'Age'] = mean_ages</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We have described a few different ways of filling in the missing values within the Age column, but by no means has this been an exhaustive discussion. There are many more methods that we could use to fill the missing data: we could apply random values within one standard deviation of the mean for the grouped data, and we could also look at grouping the data by sex and the number of parents/children (Parch) or by the number of siblings, or by ticket class, sex, and the number of parents/children. What is most important about the decisions made during this process is the end result of the prediction accuracy. We may need to try different options, rerun our models, and consider the effect on the accuracy of final predictions. Thus, selecting the features or components that provide the model with the most predictive power. You will find that, during this process, you will try a few different features, run the model, look at the end result, and repeat this process until you are happy with the performance.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The ultimate goal of this supervised learning problem is to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic given the information we have available. So, that means that the Survived column provides our labels for training. What are we going to do if we are missing 418 of the labels? If this was a project where we had control over the collection of the data and access to its origins, we would obviously correct this by recollecting or asking for the labels to be clarified. With the Titanic dataset, we do not have this ability so we must make another educated judgment call. One approach would be to drop those rows from the training data, and later use a model trained on the (smaller) training set to predict the outcome for the others (this is, in fact, the task given in the Kaggle Titanic competition). In some business problems, we may not have the option of simply ignoring these rows; we might be trying to predict future outcomes of a very critical process and this data is all we have. We could try some unsupervised learning techniques to see whether there are some patterns in the survival information that we could use. However, by estimating the ground truth labels by means of unsupervised techniques, we may introduce significant noise into the dataset, reducing our ability to accurately predict survival.</p>

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Class Imbalance</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Missing data is not the only problem that may be present within a dataset. Class imbalance – that is, having more of one class or classes compared to another – can be a significant problem, particularly in the case of classification problems (we'll see more on classification in Chapter 5, Classification Techniques), where we are trying to predict which class (or classes) a sample is from. Looking at our Survived column, we can see that there are far more people who perished (Survived equals 0) than survived (Survived equals 1) in the dataset, as you can see in the following code:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">len(df.loc[df.Survived ==1])</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output is as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">342</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The number of people who perished are:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">len(df.loc[df.Survived ==0])</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output is as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">549</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">If we don't take this class imbalance into account, the predictive power of our model could be significantly reduced as, during training, the model would simply need to guess that the person did not survive to be correct 61% (549 / (549 + 342)) of the time. If, in reality, the actual survival rate was, say, 50%, then when being applied to unseen data, our model would predict did not survive too often.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There are a few options available for managing class imbalance, one of which, similar to the missing data scenario, is to randomly remove samples from the over-represented class until balance has been achieved. Again, this option is not ideal, or perhaps even appropriate, as it involves ignoring available data. A more constructive example may be to oversample the under-represented class by randomly copying samples from the under-represented class in the dataset to boost the number of samples. While removing data can lead to accuracy issues due to discarding useful information, oversampling the under-represented class can lead to being unable to predict the label of unseen data, also known as overfitting (which we will cover in Chapter 6, Ensemble Modeling).</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Adding some random noise to the input features for oversampled data may prevent some degree of overfitting, but this is highly dependent on the dataset itself. As with missing data, it is important to check the effect of any class imbalance corrections on the overall model performance. It is relatively straightforward to copy more data into a DataFrame using the append method, which works in a very similar fashion to lists. If we wanted to copy the first row to the end of the DataFrame, we would do this:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_oversample = df.append(df.iloc[0])</p>
		<div style="page-break-before: always;"/>
	

		<br/>
		<h4 class="style0">Low Sample Size</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The field of machine learning can be considered a branch of the larger field of statistics. As such, the principles of confidence and sample size can also be applied to understand the issues with a small dataset. Recall that if we were to take measurements from a data source with high variance, then the degree of uncertainty in the measurements would also be high and more samples would be required to achieve a specified confidence in the value of the mean. The sample principles can be applied to machine learning datasets. Those datasets with a variance in the features with the most predictive power generally require more samples for reasonable performance as more confidence is also required.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There are a few techniques that can be used to compensate for a reduced sample size, such as transfer learning. However, these lie outside the scope of this book. Ultimately, though, there is only so much that can be done with a small dataset, and significant performance increases may only occur once the sample size is increased.</p>

		<h4 class="style0">Activity 1.01: Implementing Pandas Functions</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this activity, we will test ourselves on the various pandas functions we have learned about in this chapter. We will use the same Titanic dataset for this.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The steps to be performed are as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Open a new Jupyter notebook.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Use pandas to load the Titanic dataset and use the head function on the dataset to display the top rows of the dataset. Describe the summary data for all columns.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">We don't need the Unnamed: 0 column. In Exercise 1.03: Advanced Indexing and Selection, we demonstrated how to remove the column using the del command. How else could we remove this column? Remove this column without using del.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Compute the mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum values for the columns of the DataFrame without using describe. Note that you can find the minimum and maximum values using the df.min() and df.max() functions.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Use the quantile method to get values for the 33, 66, and 99% quantiles.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Find how many passengers were from each class using the groupby method.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Find how many passengers were from each class answer by using selecting/indexing methods to count the members of each class. You can use the unique() method to find out the unique values of each class.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Confirm that the answers to Step 6 and Step 7 match.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Determine who the eldest passenger in third class was.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">For a number of machine learning problems, it is very common to scale the numerical values between 0 and 1. Use the agg method with Lambda functions to scale the Fare and Age columns between 0 and 1.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">There is one individual in the dataset without a listed Fare value, which can be established as follows:</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_nan_fare = df.loc[(df.Fare.isna())]</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">df_nan_fare</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>
		<div>
			<img src="../Images/image-WVCTUMST.jpg" alt="Figure 1.24: Individual without a listed fare value&#13;&#10;" height="100%"/>
		</div>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0" style="text-align: center">Figure 1.24: Individual without a listed fare value</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">Replace the NaN value of this row in the main DataFrame with the mean Fare value for those corresponding to the same class and Embarked location using the groupby method.</p>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">The output will be as follows:</p>
		<br style="line-height: 1,4"/>

		<h4 class="style2">Note</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style2">The solution for this activity can be found via this link.</p>

		<h4 class="style0">Summary</h4>
		<br/>
		<p class="style0">In this chapter, we introduced the concept of supervised machine learning, along with a number of use cases, including the automation of manual tasks such as identifying hairstyles from the 1960s and 1980s. In this introduction, we encountered the concept of labeled datasets and the process of mapping one information set (the input data or features) to the corresponding labels. We took a practical approach to the process of loading and cleaning data using Jupyter notebooks and the extremely powerful pandas library. Note that this chapter has only covered a small fraction of the functionality within pandas, and that an entire book could be dedicated to the library itself. It is recommended that you become familiar with reading the pandas documentation and continue to develop your pandas skills through practice. The final section of this chapter covered a number of data quality issues that need to be considered to develop a high-performing supervised learning model, including missing data, class imbalance, and low sample sizes. We discussed a number of options for managing such issues and emphasized the importance of checking these mitigations against the performance of the model. In the next chapter, we will extend the data cleaning process that we covered and investigate the data exploration and visualization process. Data exploration is a critical aspect of any machine learning solution since without a comprehensive knowledge of the dataset, it would be almost impossible to model the information provided.</p>
