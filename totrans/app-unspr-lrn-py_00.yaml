- en: '*Applied Unsupervised Learning with Python* guides you through the best practices
    for using unsupervised learning techniques in tandem with Python libraries to
    extract meaningful information from unstructured data. The book begins by explaining
    how basic clustering works to find similar data points in a dataset. Once you
    are well-versed with the k-means algorithm and how it operates, you''ll learn
    what dimensionality reduction is and where to apply it. As you progress, you''ll
    learn various neural network techniques and how they can improve your model. While
    studying the applications of unsupervised learning, you will also learn how to
    mine topics that are trending on Twitter. You will complete the book by challenging
    yourself with various interesting activities, such as performing market basket
    analysis and identifying relationships between different products.'
