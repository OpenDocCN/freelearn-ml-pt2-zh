- en: '*Chapter 1*, *Getting Started with Machine Learning and Python*, will kick
    off your Python machine learning journey. It starts with what machine learning
    is, why we need it, and its evolution over the last few decades. It then discusses
    typical machine learning tasks and explores several essential techniques of working
    with data and working with models, in a practical and fun way. You will also set
    up the software and tools needed for examples and projects in the upcoming chapters.'

- en: '*Chapter 2*, *Building a Movie Recommendation Engine with Naïve Bayes*, focuses
    on classification, specifically binary classification and Naïve Bayes. The goal
    of the chapter is to build a movie recommendation system. You will learn the fundamental
    concepts of classification, and about Naïve Bayes, a simple yet powerful algorithm.
    It also demonstrates how to fine-tune a model, which is an important skill for
    every data science or machine learning practitioner to learn.'

    introduces and explains in depth tree-based algorithms (including decision trees,
    random forests, and boosted trees) throughout the course of solving the advertising
    click-through rate problem. You will explore decision trees from the root to the
    leaves, and work on implementations of tree models from scratch, using scikit-learn
    and XGBoost. Feature importance, feature selection, and ensemble will be covered
    alongside.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 4*, *Predicting Online Ad Click-Through with Logistic Regression*,
    is a continuation of the ad click-through prediction project, with a focus on
    a very scalable classification model—logistic regression. You will explore how
    logistic regression works, and how to work with large datasets. The chapter also
    covers categorical variable encoding, L1 and L2 regularization, feature selection,
    online learning, and stochastic gradient descent.'

- en: '*Chapter 5*, *Predicting Stock Prices with Regression Algorithms*, focuses
    on several popular regression algorithms, including linear regression, regression
    tree and regression forest. It will encourage you to utilize them to tackle a
    billion (or trillion) dollar problem—stock price prediction. You will practice
    solving regression problems using scikit-learn and TensorFlow.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 6*, *Predicting Stock Prices with Artificial Neural Networks*, introduces
    and explains in depth neural network models. It covers the building blocks of
    neural networks, and important concepts such as activation functions, feedforward,
    and backpropagation. You will start by building the simplest neural network and
    go deeper by adding more layers to it. We will implement neural networks from
    scratch, use TensorFlow and PyTorch, and train a neural network to predict stock
    prices.'

- en: '*Chapter 7*, *Mining the 20 Newsgroups Dataset with Text Analysis Techniques*,
    will start the second step of your learning journey—unsupervised learning. It
    explores a natural language processing problem—exploring newsgroups data. You
    will gain hands-on experience in working with text data, especially how to convert
    words and phrases into machine-readable values and how to clean up words with
    little meaning. You will also visualize text data using a dimension reduction
    technique called t-SNE. Finally, you will learn how to represent words with embedding
    vectors.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '*Chapter 8*, *Discovering Underlying Topics in the Newsgroups Dataset with
    Clustering and Topic Modeling*, talks about identifying different groups of observations
    from data in an unsupervised manner. You will cluster the newsgroups data using
    the K-means algorithm, and detect topics using non-negative matrix factorization
    and latent Dirichlet allocation. You will be amused by how many interesting themes
    you are able to mine from the 20 newsgroups dataset!'

    journey of supervised learning and classification. Specifically, it focuses on
    multiclass classification and support vector machine classifiers. It discusses
    how the support vector machine algorithm searches for a decision boundary in order
    to separate data from different classes. You will implement the algorithm with
    scikit-learn, and apply it to solve various real-life problems including face
    recognition.'

    is about using **Convolutional Neural Networks** (**CNNs**), a very powerful modern
    machine learning model, to classify images of clothing. It covers the building
    blocks and architecture of CNNs, and their implementation using PyTorch. After
    exploring the data of clothing images, you will develop CNN models to categorize
    the images into ten classes, and utilize data augmentation and transfer learning
    techniques to boost the classifier.'

    starts by defining sequential learning, and exploring how **Recurrent Neural Networks**
    (**RNNs**) are well suited for it. You will learn about various types of RNNs
    and their common applications. You will implement RNNs with PyTorch, and apply
    them to solve three interesting sequential learning problems: sentiment analysis
    on IMDb movie reviews, stock price forecasting, and text auto-generation.'

    Models*, dives into the Transformer neural network, designed for sequential learning.
    It focuses on crucial parts of the input sequence and captures long-range relationships
    better than RNNs. You will explore two cutting-edge Transformer models BERT and
    GPT, and use them for sentiment analysis and text generation, which surpass the
    performance achieved in the previous chapter.'

    explores a multimodal model, CLIP, that merges visual and textual data. This powerful
    model can understand connections between images and text. You will dive into its
    architecture and how it learns, then build an image search engine. Finally, you
    will cap it all off with a zero-shot image classification project, pushing the
    boundaries of what this model can do.'

    Learning*, is about learning from experience, and interacting with the environment.
    After exploring the fundamentals of reinforcement learning, you will explore the
    FrozenLake environment with a simple dynamic programming algorithm. You will learn
    about Monte Carlo learning and use it for value approximation and control. You
    will also develop temporal difference algorithms and use Q-learning to solve the
    taxi problem.'
