- en: Machine learning algorithms are an integral part of almost all modern applications.
    To make the learning process faster and more accurate, you need a tool flexible
    and powerful enough to help you build machine learning algorithms quickly and
    easily. With *The Machine Learning Workshop, Second Edition*, you'll master the
    scikit-learn library and become proficient in developing clever machine learning
    algorithms.

- en: '*The Machine Learning Workshop, Second Edition,* begins by demonstrating how
    unsupervised and supervised learning algorithms work by analyzing a real-world
    dataset of wholesale customers. Once you''ve got to grips with the basics, you''ll
    develop an artificial neural network using scikit-learn and then improve its performance
    by fine-tuning hyperparameters. Towards the end of the workshop, you''ll study
    the dataset of a bank''s marketing activities and build machine learning models
    that can list clients who are likely to subscribe to a term deposit. You''ll also
    learn how to compare these models and select the optimal one.'

- en: By the end of *The Machine Learning Workshop, Second Edition*, you'll not only
    have learned the difference between supervised and unsupervised models and their
    applications in the real world, but you'll also have developed the skills required
    to get started with programming your very own machine learning algorithms.

    your input data, separating the features from the target, dealing with messy data,
    and rescaling the values of data.'
