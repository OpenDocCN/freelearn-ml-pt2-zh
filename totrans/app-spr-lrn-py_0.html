			<p>Machine learning—the ability of a machine to give correct answers based on input data—has revolutionized the way we do business. Applied Supervised Learning with Python provides a rich understanding of how you can apply machine learning techniques to your data science projects using Python. You'll explore Jupyter notebooks, a technology that's widely used in academic and commercial circles with support for running inline code.</p>
			<p>With the help of fun examples, you'll gain experience working on the Python machine learning toolkit—from performing basic data cleaning and processing to working with a range of regression and classification algorithms. Once you've grasped the basics, you'll learn how to build and train your own models using advanced techniques such as decision trees, ensemble modeling, validation, and error metrics. You'll also learn data visualization techniques using powerful Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.</p>
			<p>This book also covers ensemble modeling and random forest classifiers, along with other methods for combining results from multiple models, and concludes by delving into cross-validation to test your algorithm and check how well the model works on unseen data.</p>
			<p>By the end of this book, you'll be equipped to not only work with machine learning algorithms, but also be able to create some of your own!</p>

			<p><strong class="bold">Benjamin Johnston</strong> is a senior data scientist for one of the world's leading data-driven medtech companies and is involved in the development of innovative digital solutions throughout the entire product development pathway, from problem definition, to solution research and development, through to final deployment. He is currently completing his PhD in machine learning, specializing in image processing and deep convolutional neural networks. He has more than 10 years' experience in medical device design and development, working in a variety of technical roles and holds first-class honors bachelor's degrees in both engineering and medical science from the University of Sydney, Australia.</p>
			<p><strong class="bold">Ishita Mathur</strong> has worked as a data scientist for 2.5 years with product-based start-ups working with business concerns in various domains and formulating them as technical problems that can be solved using data and machine learning. Her current work at GO-JEK involves the end-to-end development of machine learning projects, by working as part of a product team on defining, prototyping, and implementing data science models within the product. She completed her masters' degree in high-performance computing with data science at the University of Edinburgh, UK, and her bachelor's degree with honors in physics at St. Stephen's College, Delhi.</p>

			<h3 id="_idParaDest-9"><a id="_idTextAnchor009"/>Conventions</h3>
			<p>Code words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles are shown as follows: "This can be easily verified using Python's built-in <strong class="inline">type</strong> function."</p>
			<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
			<p class="snippet">description_features = [</p>
			<p class="snippet">    'injuries_description', 'damage_description',</p>
			<p class="snippet">    'total_injuries_description', 'total_damage_description'</p>
			<p class="snippet">]</p>
			<p>New terms and important words are shown in bold. Words that you see on the screen, for example, in menus or dialog boxes, appear in the text like this: "Click on the <strong class="bold">Untitled</strong> text and a popup will appear allowing you to rename the notebook."</p>
