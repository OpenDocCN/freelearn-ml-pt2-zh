  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The fundamental aim of this book is help its readers quickly deploy, optimize,
    and evaluate every kind of machine learning algorithm that scikit-learn provides
    in an agile manner.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Readers will learn how to deploy supervised machine learning algorithms, such
    as logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, linear regression, Support Vector
    Machines, Naive Bayes, and tree-based algorithms, in order to solve classification
    and regression machine learning problems.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Readers will also learn how to deploy unsupervised machine learning algorithms
    such as the k-means algorithm in order to cluster unlabeled data into groups.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally, readers will be provided with different techniques to visually interpret
    and evaluate the performance of the algorithms that they build.
