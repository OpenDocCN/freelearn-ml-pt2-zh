- en: One could argue that it is a fortunate coincidence that you are holding this
    book in your hands (or have it on your eBook reader). After all, there are millions
    of books printed every year, which are read by millions of readers. And then there
    is this book read by you. One could also argue that a couple of machine learning
    algorithms played their role in leading you to this book—or this book to you.
    And we, the authors, are happy that you want to understand more about the hows
    and whys.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most of the book will cover the *how*. How has data to be processed so that
    machine learning algorithms can make the most out of it? How should one choose
    the right algorithm for a problem at hand?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Occasionally, we will also cover the *why*. Why is it important to measure correctly?
    Why does one algorithm outperform another one in a given scenario?
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We know that there is much more to learn to be an expert in the field. After
    all, we only covered some *hows* and just a tiny fraction of the *whys*. But in
    the end, we hope that this mixture will help you to get up and running as quickly
    as possible.

- en: '[Chapter 1](ch01.html "Chapter 1. Getting Started with Python Machine Learning"),
    *Getting Started with Python Machine Learning*, introduces the basic idea of machine
    learning with a very simple example. Despite its simplicity, it will challenge
    us with the risk of overfitting.'

- en: '[Chapter 2](ch02.html "Chapter 2. Classifying with Real-world Examples"), *Classifying
    with Real-world Examples*, uses real data to learn about classification, whereby
    we train a computer to be able to distinguish different classes of flowers.'

- en: '[Chapter 3](ch03.html "Chapter 3. Clustering – Finding Related Posts"), *Clustering
    – Finding Related Posts*, teaches how powerful the bag of words approach is, when
    we apply it to finding similar posts without really "understanding" them.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 4](ch04.html "Chapter 4. Topic Modeling"), *Topic Modeling*, moves
    beyond assigning each post to a single cluster and assigns them to several topics
    as a real text can deal with multiple topics.'

- en: '[Chapter 5](ch05.html "Chapter 5. Classification – Detecting Poor Answers"),
    *Classification – Detecting Poor Answers*, teaches how to use the bias-variance
    trade-off to debug machine learning models though this chapter is mainly on using
    a logistic regression to find whether a user''s answer to a question is good or
    bad.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 6](ch06.html "Chapter 6. Classification II – Sentiment Analysis"),
    *Classification II – Sentiment Analysis*, explains how Naïve Bayes works, and
    how to use it to classify tweets to see whether they are positive or negative.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 7](ch07.html "Chapter 7. Regression"), *Regression*, explains how
    to use the classical topic, regression, in handling data, which is still relevant
    today. You will also learn about advanced regression techniques such as the Lasso
    and ElasticNets.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 8](ch08.html "Chapter 8. Recommendations"), *Recommendations*, builds
    recommendation systems based on costumer product ratings. We will also see how
    to build recommendations just from shopping data without the need for ratings
    data (which users do not always provide).'

- en: '[Chapter 9](ch09.html "Chapter 9. Classification – Music Genre Classification"),
    *Classification – Music Genre Classification*, makes us pretend that someone has
    scrambled our huge music collection, and our only hope to create order is to let
    a machine learner classify our songs. It will turn out that it is sometimes better
    to trust someone else''s expertise than creating features ourselves.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '[Chapter 10](ch10.html "Chapter 10. Computer Vision"), *Computer Vision*, teaches
    how to apply classification in the specific context of handling images by extracting
    features from data. We will also see how these methods can be adapted to find
    similar images in a collection.'

    Reduction*, teaches us what other methods exist that can help us in downsizing
    data so that it is chewable by our machine learning algorithms.'

- en: '[Chapter 12](ch12.html "Chapter 12. Bigger Data"), *Bigger Data*, explores
    some approaches to deal with larger data by taking advantage of multiple cores
    or computing clusters. We also have an introduction to using cloud computing (using
    Amazon Web Services as our cloud provider).'

    learning using open source libraries. We will walk through the basic modes of
    machine learning based on realistic examples.

    their systems. Python is a flexible language for rapid prototyping, while the
    underlying algorithms are all written in optimized C or C++. Thus the resulting
    code is fast and robust enough to be used in production as well.
