- en: Now that we have a very basic understanding of probability theory and Bayesian
    statistics, we are going to learn how to build probabilistic models using computational
    tools. Specifically, we are going to learn about probabilistic programming with
    PyMC [[Abril-Pla et al.](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023), [2023](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023)].
    The basic idea is that we use code to specify statistical models and then PyMC
    will solve those models for us. We will not need to write Bayes’ theorem in explicit
    form. This is a good strategy for two reasons. First, many models do not lead
    to an analytic closed form, and thus we can only solve those models using numerical
    techniques. Second, modern Bayesian statistics is mainly done by writing code.
    We will be able to see that probabilistic programming offers an effective way
    to build and solve complex models and allows us to focus more on model design,
    evaluation, and interpretation, and less on mathematical or computational details.

  zh: 现在我们对概率理论和贝叶斯统计有了非常基础的理解，接下来我们将学习如何使用计算工具构建概率模型。具体来说，我们将学习如何使用 PyMC 进行概率编程 [[Abril-Pla
    等人](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023), [2023](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023)]。基本的思想是，我们通过代码来指定统计模型，然后
    PyMC 将为我们求解这些模型。我们不需要显式地写出贝叶斯定理。这样做有两个原因。首先，许多模型无法得到解析解，因此我们只能使用数值方法来求解这些模型。其次，现代贝叶斯统计主要通过编写代码来完成。我们将看到，概率编程提供了一种有效的方法来构建和求解复杂模型，它让我们能够更多地关注模型设计、评估和解释，而少关注数学或计算的细节。

- en: Bayesian statistics is conceptually very simple. We have the *knowns* and the
    *unknowns*, and we use Bayes’ theorem to condition the latter on the former. If
    we are lucky, this process will reduce the uncertainty about the *unknowns*. Generally,
    we refer to the *knowns* as **data** and treat it like constants, and the *unknowns*
    as **parameters** and treat them as *random variables*.

- en: Although conceptually simple, fully probabilistic models often lead to analytically
    intractable expressions. For many years, this was a real problem and one of the
    main issues that hindered the adoption of Bayesian methods beyond some niche applications.
    The arrival of the computational era and the development of numerical methods
    that, at least in principle, can be used to solve any inference problem, have
    dramatically transformed the Bayesian data analysis practice. We can think of
    these numerical methods as *universal inference engines*. The possibility of automating
    the inference process has led to the development of **probabilistic programming
    languages** (**PPLs**), which allows a clear separation between model creation
    and inference. In the PPL framework, users specify a full probabilistic model
    by writing a few lines of code, and then inference follows automatically.

    PPL 框架中，用户通过编写几行代码来指定完整的概率模型，然后推断过程会自动进行。
- en: It is expected that probabilistic programming will have a major impact on data
    science and other disciplines by enabling practitioners to build complex probabilistic
    models in a less time-consuming and less error-prone way. I think one good analogy
    for the impact that programming languages can have on scientific computing is
    the introduction of the Fortran programming language more than six decades ago.
    While nowadays Fortran has lost its shine, at one time, it was considered revolutionary.
    For the first time, scientists moved away from computational details and began
    focusing on building numerical methods, models, and simulations more naturally.
    It is interesting to see that some folks are working on making Fortran cool again,

    pass the data using the `observed` argument. The observed values can be passed

    PyMC is automating a lot of tasks. For the time being, we are going to treat that

    understand is that under the hood we will be using numerical methods to compute
    the posterior distribution. In principle, these numerical methods are capable
    of solving any model we can write. The cost we pay for this generality is that
    the solution is going to take the form of samples from the posterior. Later, we
    will be able to corroborate that these samples come from a Beta distribution,
    as we learned from the previous chapter. Because the numerical methods are stochastic,
    the samples will vary every time we run them. However, if the inference process
    works as expected, the samples will be representative of the posterior distribution
    and thus we will obtain the same conclusion from any of those samples. The details
    of what happens under the hood and how to check if the samples are indeed trustworthy

- en: The first and second lines tell us that PyMC has automatically assigned the
    NUTS sampler (one inference engine that works very well for continuous variables),
    and has used a method to initialize that sampler (these methods need some initial
    guess of where to start sampling). The third line says that PyMC will run four
    chains in parallel, thus we will get four independent samples from the posterior.
    As PyMC attempts to parallelize these chains across the available processors in
    your machine, we will get the four for the price of one. The exact number of chains
    is computed taking into account the number of processors in your machine; you
    can change it using the `chains` argument for the `sample` function. The next
    line tells us which variables are being sampled by which sampler. For this particular
    case, this line is not adding new information because NUTS is used to sample the
    only variable we have, *θ*. However, this is not always the case because PyMC
    can assign different samplers to different variables. PyMC has rules to ensure
    that each variable is associated with the best possible sampler. Users can manually
    assign samplers using the `step` argument of the `sample` function, but you will
    hardly need to do that.

  zh: 第一行和第二行告诉我们，PyMC 已经自动分配了 NUTS 采样器（一个非常适合连续变量的推断引擎），并使用了一种方法来初始化该采样器（这些方法需要对开始采样的位置进行一些初步猜测）。第三行说
    PyMC 将并行运行四个链，因此我们将从后验中获得四个独立的样本。由于 PyMC 尝试将这些链并行化到机器上可用的处理器中，我们将以一个价格获得四个样本。链的确切数量是根据机器中的处理器数量计算的；您可以使用
    `chains` 参数来更改 `sample` 函数的链数。接下来的这一行告诉我们每个采样器正在采样哪些变量。对于这个特定的例子，这一行并没有添加新信息，因为
    NUTS 被用来采样我们唯一的变量 *θ*。然而，这并不总是这样，因为 PyMC 可以为不同的变量分配不同的采样器。PyMC 有规则来确保每个变量都与最佳的采样器关联。用户可以使用
    `sample` 函数的 `step` 参数手动分配采样器，但您几乎不需要这么做。
- en: Finally, the last line is a progress bar, with several related metrics indicating
    how fast the sampler is working, including the number of iterations per second.
    If you run the code, you will see the progress bar get updated really fast. Here,
    we are seeing the last stage when the sampler has finished its work. You will
    notice that we have asked for 1,000 samples, but PyMC is computing 8,000 samples.
    We have 1,000 draws per chain to tune the sampling algorithm (NUTS, in this example).
    These draws will be discarded by default; PyMC uses them to increase the efficiency
    and reliability of the sampling method, which are both important to obtain a useful
    approximation to the posterior. We also have 1,000 productive draws per chain
    for a total of 4,000\. These are the ones we are going to use as our posterior.
    We can change the number of tuning steps with the `tune` argument of the sample
    function and the number of draws with the `draw` argument.

    1,000 个样本，但 PyMC 实际上计算了 8,000 个样本。每条链有 1,000 个抽样用于调节采样算法（在本例中是 NUTS）。这些抽样默认会被丢弃；PyMC
    使用它们来提高采样方法的效率和可靠性，这对于获得有用的后验近似是非常重要的。每条链还有 1,000 个有效抽样，共计 4,000 个。这些是我们将用作后验分布的样本。我们可以通过
    `tune` 参数调整调节步骤的数量，通过 `draw` 参数调整抽样的数量。

    mean of the posterior, the third column is the standard deviation of the posterior,
    and the last two columns are the lower and upper boundaries of the 94% highest
    density interval. Thus, according to our model and data, we think the value of
    *θ* is likely to be 0.34 with a 94% probability that it is actually between 0.03
    and 0.66\. We can report a similar summary using the standard deviation. The advantage
    of the standard deviation over the HDI is that it is a more popular statistic.
    As a disadvantage, we have to be more careful interpreting it; otherwise, it can
    lead to meaningless results. For example, if we compute the mean ± 2 standard
    deviations, we will get the intervals (-0.02, 0.7); the upper value is not that
    far from 0.66, which we got from the HDI, but the lower bound is actually outside
    the possible values of *θ*, which is between 0 and 1.

- en: Gaussians are very appealing from a mathematical point of view. Working with
    them is relatively easy, and many operations applied to Guassians return another
    Gaussian. Additionally, many natural phenomena can be nicely approximated using
    Gaussians; essentially, almost every time that we measure the average of something,
    using a *big enough* sample size, that average will be distributed as a Gaussian.
    The details of when this is true, when this is not true, and when this is more
    or less true, are elaborated in the **central limit theorem** (CLT); you may want
    to stop reading now and search about this really *central* statistical concept
    (terrible pun intended).

    a cliché, the height (and almost any other trait of a person, for that matter)
    is the result of many environmental factors and many genetic factors, and hence
    we get a nice Gaussian distribution for the height of adult people. Indeed, we
    get a mixture of two Gaussians, which is the result of overlapping the distribution
    of heights of women and men, but you get the idea. In summary, Gaussians are easy
    to work with and abundant in natural phenomena; hence, many of the statistical
    methods you may already know assume normality. Thus, it is important to learn
    how to build these models, and then it is equally important to learn how to relax
    the normality assumptions, something that is surprisingly easy in a Bayesian framework
    and with modern computational tools such as PyMC.

- en: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a powerful technique used to study molecules
    and also living things such as humans, sunflowers, and yeast (because, after all,
    *we are just a bunch of molecules*). NMR allows you to measure different kinds
    of observable quantities related to interesting unobservable molecular properties
    [Arroyuelo et al.](Bibliography.xhtml#Xarroyuelo_2021) [[2021](Bibliography.xhtml#Xarroyuelo_2021)].
    One of these observables is known as chemical shift, which we can only get for
    the nuclei of certain types of atoms. The details belong to quantum chemistry
    and they are irrelevant to this discussion. For all we care at the moment, we
    could have been measuring the height of a group of people, the average time to
    travel back home, or the weights of bags of oranges. In these examples the variables
    are continuous, and it makes sense to think of them as an average value plus a
    dispersion. Sometimes we can use a Gaussian model for discrete variables if the
    number of possible values is large enough; for example, bonobos are very promiscuous,
    so maybe we can model the number of sexual partners of our cousins with a Gaussian.

    with this kind of measurement, I would say this model is a reasonable enough representation
    of the data and a useful one for most of my analysis. Nevertheless, it is important
    to keep in mind that we could find other models that better accommodate the whole
    dataset, including the two observations that are far from the bulk of the data.

    distribution for the likelihood, we are indirectly assuming that we are not expecting
    to see a lot of data points far away from the bulk. *Figure [2.13](#x1-54009r13)*
    shows the result of combining these assumptions with the data. Since the tails
    of the Normal distribution fall quickly as we move away from the mean, the Normal
    distribution (at least an anthropomorphized one) is *surprised by seeing* those
    two points and *reacts* in two ways, moving its mean towards those points and
    increasing its standard deviation. Another intuitive way of interpreting this
    is by saying that those points have an excessive weight in determining the parameters
    of the Normal distribution.

    It has three parameters: a location parameter *μ*, a scale parameter *σ*, and
    a normality parameter *ν*. This distribution’s name is Student’s t-distribution.
    *Figure [2.14](#x1-56002r14)* shows members of this family. When *ν* = ∞ the distribution
    is the Normal distribution, *μ* is the mean and *σ* is the standard deviation.
    When *ν* = 1, we get the Cauchy or Lorentz distribution. *ν* can go from 0 to
    ∞. The lower this number, the heavier their tails. We can also say that the lower
    the value of *ν*, the higher the kurtosis. The kurtosis is the fourth moment,
    as you may remember from the previous chapter. By heavy tails, we mean that it
    is more probable to find values away from the mean compared to a Normal, or in
    other words, values are not as concentrated around the mean as in a lighter tail
    distribution like the Normal. For example, 95% of the values from a Student’s
    t (*μ* = 0*,σ* = 1*,ν* = 1) are found between -12.7 and 12.7\. Instead, for a

    that *most of the action* happens for relatively small values of *ν*. Hence, we
    can say that the Exponential prior with a mean of 30 is a weakly informative prior
    telling the model we more or less think should be around 30 but can move to smaller
    and larger values with ease. In many problems, estimating *ν* is of no direct

    mean and the scale are estimated by weighting the data points close to the bulk
    more than those apart from it. As a rule of thumb, for values of *ν >* 2 and *not

- en: InferenceData is a rich container for the results of Bayesian inference. A modern
    Bayesian analysis potentially generates many sets of data including posterior
    samples and posterior predictive samples. But we also have observed data, samples
    from the prior, and even statistics generated by the sampler. All this data, and
    more, can be stored in an InferenceData object. To help keep all this information
    organized, each one of these sets of data has its own group. For instance, the
    posterior samples are stored in the `posterior` group. The observed data is stored
    in the `observed_data` group.

    group. For example, when we want to test a new drug, we want to compare the new
    drug (the treatment) against a placebo (the control group). The placebo effect
    is a psychological phenomenon where a patient experiences perceived improvements
    in their symptoms or condition after receiving an inactive substance or treatment.
    By comparing the effects of the drug with a placebo group in clinical trials,
    researchers can discern whether the drug is genuinely effective. The placebo effect
    is an example of the broader challenge in experimental design and statistical
    analysis of the difficulty of accounting for all factors in an experiment.

    means scaled by the pooled standard deviation of both groups. By taking the pooled
    standard deviation, we are standardizing the differences of means. This is important
    because when you have a difference of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.1, the effect
    size is larger than the same difference when the standard deviation is 10\. A
    Cohen’s d can be interpreted as a Z-score (a standard score). A Z-score is the
    signed number of standard deviations by which a value differs from the mean value
    of what is being observed or measured. Thus, a value of 0.5 Cohen’s d could be
    interpreted as a difference of 0.5 standard deviations from one group to the other.

    several analyses for the same or similar problems, we can get used to a Cohen’s
    d of say 1\. So when we get a Cohen’s d of say 2, we know that we have something
    important (or someone made a mistake somewhere!). If you do not have this practice

    and Sunday. For all the other comparisons, we cannot rule out a difference of
    zero, at least according to the HDI-reference-value-overlap criteria. But even
    for that case, the average difference is ≈ 0*.*5 dollars. Is that difference large
    enough? Is that difference enough to accept working on Sunday and missing the
    opportunity to spend time with family or friends? Is that difference enough to
    justify averaging the tips over the four days and giving every waitress and waiter

- en: Although Bayesian statistics is conceptually simple, fully probabilistic models
    often lead to analytically intractable expressions. For many years, this was a
    huge barrier, hindering the wide adoption of Bayesian methods. Fortunately, maths,
    statistics, physics, and computer science came to the rescue in the form of numerical
    methods that are capable—at least in principle—of solving any inference problem.
    The possibility of automating the inference process has led to the development
    of probabilistic programming languages, allowing a clear separation between model
    definition and inference. PyMC is a Python library for probabilistic programming
    with a very simple, intuitive, and easy-to-read syntax that is also very close
    to the statistical syntax used to describe probabilistic models.
  id: totrans-279

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We introduced the PyMC library by revisiting the coin-flip model from *Chapter
    [1](CH01.xhtml#x1-160001)*, this time without analytically deriving the posterior.
    PyMC models are defined inside a context manager. To add a probability distribution
    to a model, we just need to write a single line of code. Distributions can be
    combined and can be used as priors (unobserved variables) or likelihoods (observed
    variables). If we pass data to a distribution, it becomes a likelihood. Sampling
    can be achieved with a single line as well. PyMC allows us to get samples from
    the posterior distribution. If everything goes right, these samples will be representative
    of the correct posterior distribution and thus they will be a representation of
    the logical consequences of our model and data. We can explore the posterior generated
    by PyMC using ArviZ, a Python library that works hand-in-hand with PyMC and can
    be used, among other tasks, to help us interpret and visualize posterior distributions.
    One way of using a posterior to help us make inference-driven decisions is by
    comparing the ROPE against the HDI interval. We also briefly mentioned the notion
    of loss functions, a formal way to quantify the trade-offs and costs associated
    with making decisions in the presence of uncertainty. We learned that loss functions
    and point estimates are intimately associated.

    Generalizing to an arbitrary number of parameters is trivial with PyMC; we exemplify
    how to do this with the Gaussian and Student’s t models. The Gaussian distribution
    is a special case of the Student’s t-distribution and we showed you how to use
    the latter to perform robust inferences in the presence of outliers. In the next
    chapters, we will look at how these models can be used as part of linear regression
    models. We used a Gaussian model to compare groups. While this is sometimes framed
    in the context of hypothesis testing, we take another route and frame this task
    as a problem of inferring the effect size, an approach we generally consider to
    be richer and more productive. We also explored different ways to interpret and
    report effect sizes.

    to study one of the most important concepts in this book, hierarchical models.
    That will be the topic of the next chapter.

    with prior *θ* ∼![](img/U.PNG)(0*,*1). Are the posteriors similar or different?
    Is the sampling slower, faster, or the same? What about using a Uniform over a
    different interval such as [-1, 2]? Does the model run? What errors do you get?

    the Kruschke diagram. Use `pm.model_to_graphviz` to visualize model `comparing_groups`.

    at the empirical mean, and play with a couple of reasonable values for the standard
    deviation of this prior. How robust/sensitive are the inferences to these changes?
    What do you think of using a Gaussian, which is an unbounded distribution (goes
    from −inf to inf), to model bounded data such as this? Remember that we said it
    is not possible to observe values below 0 or above 100.

    function to take a sample from each group. Is it different from the calculation
    assuming normality? Can you explain the result?
