- en: Now that we have a very basic understanding of probability theory and Bayesian
    statistics, we are going to learn how to build probabilistic models using computational
    tools. Specifically, we are going to learn about probabilistic programming with
    PyMC [[Abril-Pla et¬†al.](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023),¬†[2023](Bibliography.xhtml#Xpymc2023)].
    The basic idea is that we use code to specify statistical models and then PyMC
    will solve those models for us. We will not need to write Bayes‚Äô theorem in explicit
    form. This is a good strategy for two reasons. First, many models do not lead
    to an analytic closed form, and thus we can only solve those models using numerical
    techniques. Second, modern Bayesian statistics is mainly done by writing code.
    We will be able to see that probabilistic programming offers an effective way
    to build and solve complex models and allows us to focus more on model design,
    evaluation, and interpretation, and less on mathematical or computational details.

- en: Bayesian statistics is conceptually very simple. We have the *knowns* and the
    *unknowns*, and we use Bayes‚Äô theorem to condition the latter on the former. If
    we are lucky, this process will reduce the uncertainty about the *unknowns*. Generally,
    we refer to the *knowns* as **data** and treat it like constants, and the *unknowns*
    as **parameters** and treat them as *random variables*.

- en: Although conceptually simple, fully probabilistic models often lead to analytically
    intractable expressions. For many years, this was a real problem and one of the
    main issues that hindered the adoption of Bayesian methods beyond some niche applications.
    The arrival of the computational era and the development of numerical methods
    that, at least in principle, can be used to solve any inference problem, have
    dramatically transformed the Bayesian data analysis practice. We can think of
    these numerical methods as *universal inference engines*. The possibility of automating
    the inference process has led to the development of **probabilistic programming
    languages** (**PPLs**), which allows a clear separation between model creation
    and inference. In the PPL framework, users specify a full probabilistic model
    by writing a few lines of code, and then inference follows automatically.

- en: It is expected that probabilistic programming will have a major impact on data
    science and other disciplines by enabling practitioners to build complex probabilistic
    models in a less time-consuming and less error-prone way. I think one good analogy
    for the impact that programming languages can have on scientific computing is
    the introduction of the Fortran programming language more than six decades ago.
    While nowadays Fortran has lost its shine, at one time, it was considered revolutionary.
    For the first time, scientists moved away from computational details and began
    focusing on building numerical methods, models, and simulations more naturally.
    It is interesting to see that some folks are working on making Fortran cool again,
    if you are interested you can check their work at [https://fortran-lang.org/en](https://fortran-lang.org/en).

    the `with` block will be automatically added to `our_first_model`. You can think
    of this as syntactic sugar to ease model specification as we do not need to manually
    assign variables to the model. The second line specifies the prior. As you can
    see, the syntax follows the mathematical notation closely. The third line specifies
    the likelihood; the syntax is almost the same as for the prior, except that we
    pass the data using the `observed` argument. The observed values can be passed
    as a Python list, a tuple, a NumPy array, or a pandas DataFrame. With that, we
    are finished with the model specification! Pretty neat, right?

    happens. Behind this innocent line, PyMC has hundreds of *oompa loompas* singing
    and baking a delicious Bayesian inference just for you! Well, not exactly, but
    PyMC is automating a lot of tasks. For the time being, we are going to treat that
    line as a black box that will give us the correct result. What is important to
    understand is that under the hood we will be using numerical methods to compute
    the posterior distribution. In principle, these numerical methods are capable
    of solving any model we can write. The cost we pay for this generality is that
    the solution is going to take the form of samples from the posterior. Later, we
    will be able to corroborate that these samples come from a Beta distribution,
    as we learned from the previous chapter. Because the numerical methods are stochastic,
    the samples will vary every time we run them. However, if the inference process
    works as expected, the samples will be representative of the posterior distribution
    and thus we will obtain the same conclusion from any of those samples. The details
    of what happens under the hood and how to check if the samples are indeed trustworthy
    will be explained in *Chapter [10](CH10.xhtml#x1-18900010)*.

- en: The first and second lines tell us that PyMC has automatically assigned the
    NUTS sampler (one inference engine that works very well for continuous variables),
    and has used a method to initialize that sampler (these methods need some initial
    guess of where to start sampling). The third line says that PyMC will run four
    chains in parallel, thus we will get four independent samples from the posterior.
    As PyMC attempts to parallelize these chains across the available processors in
    your machine, we will get the four for the price of one. The exact number of chains
    is computed taking into account the number of processors in your machine; you
    can change it using the `chains` argument for the `sample` function. The next
    line tells us which variables are being sampled by which sampler. For this particular
    case, this line is not adding new information because NUTS is used to sample the
    only variable we have, *Œ∏*. However, this is not always the case because PyMC
    can assign different samplers to different variables. PyMC has rules to ensure
    that each variable is associated with the best possible sampler. Users can manually
    assign samplers using the `step` argument of the `sample` function, but you will
    hardly need to do that.

- en: Finally, the last line is a progress bar, with several related metrics indicating
    how fast the sampler is working, including the number of iterations per second.
    If you run the code, you will see the progress bar get updated really fast. Here,
    we are seeing the last stage when the sampler has finished its work. You will
    notice that we have asked for 1,000 samples, but PyMC is computing 8,000 samples.
    We have 1,000 draws per chain to tune the sampling algorithm (NUTS, in this example).
    These draws will be discarded by default; PyMC uses them to increase the efficiency
    and reliability of the sampling method, which are both important to obtain a useful
    approximation to the posterior. We also have 1,000 productive draws per chain
    for a total of 4,000\. These are the ones we are going to use as our posterior.
    We can change the number of tuning steps with the `tune` argument of the sample
    function and the number of draws with the `draw` argument.

    arrays. PyTensor significantly enhances the speed and performance of PyMC. Despite
    the advantages, it‚Äôs worth noting that the samplers in PyMC are implemented in
    Python, which may result in slower execution at times. To address this limitation,
    PyMC allows external samplers. I recommend using nutpie, a sampler written in
    Rust. For more information on how to install and call nutpie from PyMC, please

    data; we do not need to sample that because we already know those values. Thus
    we only get two subplots. On the left, we have a **Kernel Density Estimation**
    (**KDE**) plot; this is like the smooth version of the histogram. Ideally, we
    want all chains to have a very similar KDE, like in *Figure [2.1](#x1-47005r1)*.
    On the right, we get the individual values at each sampling step; we get as many
    lines as chains. Ideally, we want it to be something that looks noisy, with no
    clear pattern, and we should have a hard time identifying one chain from the others.
    In *Chapter [10](CH10.xhtml#x1-18900010)*, we give more details on how to interpret

    expected due to random sampling, but large deviations from uniformity are a signal
    that chains are exploring different regions of the posteriors. Ideally, we want
    all chains to explore the entire posterior. In *Chapter [10](CH10.xhtml#x1-18900010)*,

    and the last two columns are the lower and upper boundaries of the 94% highest
    density interval. Thus, according to our model and data, we think the value of
    *Œ∏* is likely to be 0.34 with a 94% probability that it is actually between 0.03
    and 0.66\. We can report a similar summary using the standard deviation. The advantage
    of the standard deviation over the HDI is that it is a more popular statistic.
    As a disadvantage, we have to be more careful interpreting it; otherwise, it can
    lead to meaningless results. For example, if we compute the mean ¬± 2 standard
    deviations, we will get the intervals (-0.02, 0.7); the upper value is not that
    far from 0.66, which we got from the HDI, but the lower bound is actually outside

    Gaussians; essentially, almost every time that we measure the average of something,
    using a *big enough* sample size, that average will be distributed as a Gaussian.
    The details of when this is true, when this is not true, and when this is more
    or less true, are elaborated in the **central limit theorem** (CLT); you may want

    we get a nice Gaussian distribution for the height of adult people. Indeed, we
    get a mixture of two Gaussians, which is the result of overlapping the distribution
    of heights of women and men, but you get the idea. In summary, Gaussians are easy
    to work with and abundant in natural phenomena; hence, many of the statistical
    methods you may already know assume normality. Thus, it is important to learn
    how to build these models, and then it is equally important to learn how to relax
    the normality assumptions, something that is surprisingly easy in a Bayesian framework

    One of these observables is known as chemical shift, which we can only get for
    the nuclei of certain types of atoms. The details belong to quantum chemistry
    and they are irrelevant to this discussion. For all we care at the moment, we
    could have been measuring the height of a group of people, the average time to
    travel back home, or the weights of bags of oranges. In these examples the variables
    are continuous, and it makes sense to think of them as an average value plus a
    dispersion. Sometimes we can use a Gaussian model for discrete variables if the
    number of possible values is large enough; for example, bonobos are very promiscuous,

    to see a lot of data points far away from the bulk. *Figure [2.13](#x1-54009r13)*

    of the Normal distribution fall quickly as we move away from the mean, the Normal
    distribution (at least an anthropomorphized one) is *surprised by seeing* those
    two points and *reacts* in two ways, moving its mean towards those points and

    and also its spread. Notice how the samples extend far away from the bulk of the
    data, and how a few of the predictive samples look very flat. This is a direct
    consequence of the Student‚Äôs t-distribution expecting to see data points far away
    from the mean or bulk of the data. If you check the code used to generate *Figure
    [2.17](#x1-57014r17)* you will see that we have used `ax.set_xlim(40, 70)`.'

    of the mean and standard deviation because the outliers have the effect of decreasing
    *ŒΩ* instead of pulling the mean or increasing the standard deviation. Thus, the
    mean and the scale are estimated by weighting the data points close to the bulk
    more than those apart from it. As a rule of thumb, for values of *ŒΩ >* 2 and *not
    too small*, we can consider the scale of a Student‚Äôs t-distribution as a reasonable
    practical proxy for the standard deviation of the data after removing outliers.
    This is a rule of thumb because we know that the scale is not the standard deviation.

    because when you have a difference of 1 and a standard deviation of 0.1, the effect
    size is larger than the same difference when the standard deviation is 10\. A
    Cohen‚Äôs d can be interpreted as a Z-score (a standard score). A Z-score is the
    signed number of standard deviations by which a value differs from the mean value
    of what is being observed or measured. Thus, a value of 0.5 Cohen‚Äôs d could be

    several analyses for the same or similar problems, we can get used to a Cohen‚Äôs

- en: Although Bayesian statistics is conceptually simple, fully probabilistic models
    often lead to analytically intractable expressions. For many years, this was a
    huge barrier, hindering the wide adoption of Bayesian methods. Fortunately, maths,
    statistics, physics, and computer science came to the rescue in the form of numerical
    methods that are capable‚Äîat least in principle‚Äîof solving any inference problem.
    The possibility of automating the inference process has led to the development
    of probabilistic programming languages, allowing a clear separation between model
    definition and inference. PyMC is a Python library for probabilistic programming
    with a very simple, intuitive, and easy-to-read syntax that is also very close
    to the statistical syntax used to describe probabilistic models.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We introduced the PyMC library by revisiting the coin-flip model from *Chapter
    [1](CH01.xhtml#x1-160001)*, this time without analytically deriving the posterior.
    PyMC models are defined inside a context manager. To add a probability distribution
    to a model, we just need to write a single line of code. Distributions can be
    combined and can be used as priors (unobserved variables) or likelihoods (observed
    variables). If we pass data to a distribution, it becomes a likelihood. Sampling
    can be achieved with a single line as well. PyMC allows us to get samples from
    the posterior distribution. If everything goes right, these samples will be representative
    of the correct posterior distribution and thus they will be a representation of
    the logical consequences of our model and data. We can explore the posterior generated
    by PyMC using ArviZ, a Python library that works hand-in-hand with PyMC and can
    be used, among other tasks, to help us interpret and visualize posterior distributions.
    One way of using a posterior to help us make inference-driven decisions is by
    comparing the ROPE against the HDI interval. We also briefly mentioned the notion
    of loss functions, a formal way to quantify the trade-offs and costs associated
    with making decisions in the presence of uncertainty. We learned that loss functions
    and point estimates are intimately associated.

    Generalizing to an arbitrary number of parameters is trivial with PyMC; we exemplify
    how to do this with the Gaussian and Student‚Äôs t models. The Gaussian distribution
    is a special case of the Student‚Äôs t-distribution and we showed you how to use
    the latter to perform robust inferences in the presence of outliers. In the next
    chapters, we will look at how these models can be used as part of linear regression
    models. We used a Gaussian model to compare groups. While this is sometimes framed
    in the context of hypothesis testing, we take another route and frame this task
    as a problem of inferring the effect size, an approach we generally consider to
    be richer and more productive. We also explored different ways to interpret and
    report effect sizes.

    at the empirical mean, and play with a couple of reasonable values for the standard
    deviation of this prior. How robust/sensitive are the inferences to these changes?
    What do you think of using a Gaussian, which is an unbounded distribution (goes
    from ‚àíinf to inf), to model bounded data such as this? Remember that we said it
    is not possible to observe values below 0 or above 100.

    and the standard deviation with and without outliers. Compare those results to
    the Bayesian estimation using the Gaussian and Student‚Äôs t-distribution. What
    do you observe?

    posterior (without computing Cohen‚Äôs d first). You can use the `pm.sample_posterior_predictive()`
    function to take a sample from each group. Is it different from the calculation
    assuming normality? Can you explain the result?
