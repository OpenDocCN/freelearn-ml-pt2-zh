- en: Amazon SageMaker enables you to quickly build, train, and deploy machine learning
    models at scale without managing any infrastructure. It helps you focus on the
    machine learning problem at hand and deploy high-quality models by eliminating
    the heavy lifting typically involved in each step of the ML process. This second
    edition will help data scientists and ML developers to explore new features, such
    as SageMaker Data Wrangler, Pipelines, Clarify, Feature Store, and much more.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll start by learning how to use various capabilities of SageMaker as a single
    toolset to solve ML challenges and progress to cover features such as AutoML,
    built-in algorithms and frameworks, and writing your own code and algorithms to
    build ML models. The book will then show you how to integrate Amazon SageMaker
    with popular deep learning libraries, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, to extend
    the capabilities of existing models. You'll see how automating your workflows
    can help you get to production faster with minimum effort and at a lower cost.
    Finally, you'll explore SageMaker Debugger and SageMaker Model Monitor to detect
    quality issues in training and production.

    full spectrum of ML workflows, from experimentation, training, and monitoring
    to scaling, deployment, and automation.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This book is for software engineers, machine learning developers, data scientists,
    and AWS users who are new to using Amazon SageMaker and want to build high-quality
    machine learning models without worrying about infrastructure. Knowledge of AWS
    basics is required to grasp the concepts covered in this book more effectively.
    A solid understanding of machine learning concepts and the Python programming
    language will also be beneficial.
