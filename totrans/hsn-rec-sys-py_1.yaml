    whether that's from friends, family, external reviews, and, more recently, from
    the sources selling you the product. When you log on to Netflix or Amazon Prime,
    for example, you will see a list of movies and television shows the service thinks
    you will like based on your past watching (and rating) history. Facebook suggests
    people it thinks you may know and would probably like to add. It also curates
    a News Feed for you based on the posts you've liked, the people you've be-friended,
    and the pages you've followed. Amazon recommends items to you as you browse for
    a particular product. It shows you similar products from a competing source and
    suggests auxiliary items *frequently bought together* with the product.

    of successful business for these companies. It is in Netflix's best interests
    to engage you with content that you love so that you continue to subscribe to
    its service; the more relevant the items Amazon shows you, the greater your chances
    – and volume – of purchases will be, which directly translates to greater profits.
    Equally, establishing *friendship* is key to Facebook's power and influence as
    an almost omnipotent social network, which it then uses to churn money out of
    advertising.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Recommender systems are pretty self-explanatory; as the name suggests, they
    are systems or techniques that recommend or suggest a particular product, service,
    or entity. However, these systems can be classified into the following two categories,
    based on their approach to providing recommendations.

- en: The prediction problem
  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this version of the problem, we are given a matrix of *m* users and *n* items.
    Each row of the matrix represents a user and each column represents an item. The
    value of the cell in the i^(th )row and the j^(th) column denotes the rating given
    by user *i* to item *j*. This value is usually denoted as r[ij].
  prefs: []

- en: This matrix has seven users rating six items. Therefore, m = 7 and n = 6\. User
    1 has given the item 1 a rating of 4\. Therefore, r[11] = 4.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let us now consider a more concrete example. Imagine you are Netflix and you
    have a repository of 20,000 movies and 5,000 users. You have a system in place
    that records every rating that each user gives to a particular movie. In other
    words, you have the rating matrix (of shape 5,000 × 20,000) with you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, all your users will have seen only a fraction of the movies you have
    available on your site; therefore, the matrix you have is sparse. In other words,
    most of the entries in your matrix are empty, as most users have not rated most
    of your movies.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The prediction problem, therefore, aims to predict these missing values using
    all the information it has at its disposal (the ratings recorded, data on movies,
    data on users, and so on). If it is able to predict the missing values accurately,
    it will be able to give great recommendations. For example, if user *i* has not
    used item *j*, but our system predicts a very high rating (denoted by ![](img/57a418b0-5fe0-41be-a202-275bc4162f83.png)[ij]),
    it is highly likely that *i* will love *j* should they discover it through the
    system.

    a set of *n* items, the ranking problem tries to discern the top *k* items to
    recommend to a particular user, utilizing all of the information at its disposal.

    the specific things they are looking for in their host and the space (such as
    their location, and budget). You want to display the top 10 results that satisfy
    those aforementioned conditions. This would be an example of the ranking problem.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is easy to see that the prediction problem often boils down to the ranking
    problem. If we are able to predict missing values, we can extract the top values
    and display them as our results.

    the techniques and models you use (and the success you enjoy) are heavily dependent
    on the quantity and quality of the data you possess. In this section, we will
    gain an overview of three of the most popular types of recommender systems in
    decreasing order of data they require to inorder function efficiently.

    Collaborative filters are one of the most popular recommender models used in the
    industry and have found huge success for companies such as Amazon. Collaborative
    filtering can be broadly classified into two types.
  prefs: []

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The main idea behind user-based filtering is that if we are able to find users
    that have bought and liked similar items in the past, they are more likely to
    buy similar items in the future too. Therefore, these models recommend items to
    a user that similar users have also liked. Amazon''s *Customers who bought t**his
    item also bought* is an example of this filter, as shown in the following screenshot:'

    imagine that a new video game has been launched on the market. Let's say Alice
    bought the game and loved it. Since we have discerned that their tastes in video
    games are extremely similar, it's likely that Bob will like the game too; hence,
    the system recommends the new video game to Bob.

    be similar. Therefore, if a person likes one particular item, they''re likely
    to be interested in the other item too. This is the principle on which item-based
    filtering works. Again, Amazon makes good use of this model by recommending products
    to you based on your browsing and purchase history, as shown in the following
    screenshot:'

    users. For example, imagine that Alice, Bob, and Eve have all given *War and Peace *and *The
    Picture of Dorian Gray* a rating of excellent*. *Now, when someone buys *The Brothers
    Karamazov, *the system will recommend *War and Peace *as it has identified that,
    in most cases, if someone likes one of those books, they will like the other,
    too.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H1
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One of the biggest prerequisites of a collaborative filtering system is the
    availability of data of past activity. Amazon is able to leverage collaborative
    filters so well because it has access to data concerning millions of purchases
    from millions of users.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, collaborative filters suffer from what we call the **cold start problem***. *Imagine
    you have started an e-commerce website – to build a good collaborative filtering
    system, you need data on a large number of purchases from a large number of users.
    However, you don't have either, and it's therefore difficult to build such a system
    from the start.

    to past activity. Instead, they provide recommendations based on a user profile
    and metadata it has on particular items.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Netflix is an excellent example of the aforementioned system. The first time
    you sign in to Netflix, it doesn't know what your likes and dislikes are, so it
    is not in a position to find users similar to you and recommend the movies and
    shows they have liked.

- en: As shown in the previous screenshot, what Netflix does instead is ask you to
    rate a few movies that you *have* watched before. Based on this information and
    the metadata it already has on movies, it creates a watchlist for you. For instance,
    if you enjoyed the *Harry Potter *and *Narnia *movies, the content-based system
    can identify that you like movies based on fantasy novels and will recommend a
    movie such as *Lord of the Rings *to you.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However, since content-based systems don't leverage the power of the community,
    they often come up with results that are not as impressive or relevant as the
    ones offered by collaborative filters. In other words, content-based systems usually
    provide recommendations that are *obvious. *There is little novelty in a *Lord
    of the Rings *recommendation if *Harry Potter* is your favorite movie.

- en: Knowledge-based recommenders are used for items that are very rarely bought.
    It is simply impossible to recommend such items based on past purchasing activity
    or by building a user profile. Take real estate, for instance. Real estate is
    usually a once-in-a-lifetime purchase for a family. It is not possible to have
    a history of real estate purchases for existing users to leverage into a collaborative
    filter, nor is it always feasible to ask a user their real estate purchase history.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In such cases, you build a system that asks for certain specifics and preferences
    and then provides recommendations that satisfy those aforementioned conditions.
    In the real estate example, for instance, you could ask the user about their requirements
    for a house, such as its locality, their budget, the number of rooms, and the
    number of storeys, and so on. Based on this information, you can then recommend
    properties that will satisfy all of the above conditions.

    Users know full-well what to expect from the results and are seldom taken by surprise.

    types of recommender models, including the ones we've already explained. As we've
    seen in previous sections, each model has its own set of advantages and disadvantages.
    Hybrid systems try to nullify the disadvantage of one model against an advantage
    of another.

- en: Let's consider the Netflix example again. When you sign in for the first time,
    Netflix overcomes the cold start problem of collaborative filters by using a content-based
    recommender, and, as you gradually start watching and rating movies, it brings
    its collaborative filtering mechanism into play. This is far more successful,
    so most practical recommender systems are hybrid in nature.
