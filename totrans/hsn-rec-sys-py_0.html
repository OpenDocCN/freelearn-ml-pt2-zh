<p>Recommendation systems are at the heart of almost every internet business today, from Facebook to Netflix to Amazon. Providing good recommendations, whether it's friends, movies, or groceries, goes a long way in defining user experience and enticing your customers to use and buy from your platform.</p>
<p>This book shows you how to do just that. You will learn about different kinds of recommenders used in the industry and see how to build them from scratch using Python. No need to wade through tons of linear algebra and machine learning theory, you'll get started with building and learning about recommenders as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In this book, you will build an IMDB Top 250 clone, a content-based engine that works on movie metadata, collaborative filters that make use of customer behavior data, and a hybrid recommender that incorporates content-based and collaborative filtering techniques.</p>
<p class="mce-root">With this book, all you need to get started with building recommendation systems is familiarity with Python, and by the time you're finished, you will have a great grasp of how recommenders work, and you will be in a strong position to apply the techniques learned to your own problem domains.</p>

                    <h1 class="header-title">Conventions used</h1>

            <article>
                
<p>There are a number of text conventions used throughout this book.</p>
<p><kbd>CodeInText</kbd>: <span>Indicates c</span>ode words in text, database table names, folder names, filenames, file extensions, pathnames, dummy URLs, user input, and Twitter handles. <span>Here is an example:</span> "<span>Let's now implement the SVD filter using the </span><kbd>surprise</kbd><span> package.</span>"</p>
<p>A block of code is set as follows:</p>
<pre>#Import SVD<br/>from surprise import SVD<br/><br/>#Define the SVD algorithm object<br/>svd = SVD()<br/><br/>#Evaluate the performance in terms of RMSE<br/>evaluate(svd, data, measures=['RMSE'])</pre>
<p>When we wish to draw your attention to a particular part of a code block, the relevant lines or items are set in bold:</p>
<pre> else:<br/>        #Default to a rating of 3.0 in the absence of any information<br/>        wmean_rating = 3.0<br/>    return wmean_rating<br/>score(cf_user_wmean)<br/><br/><strong>OUTPUT:<br/>1.0174483808407588</strong></pre>
<p>Any command-line input or output is written as follows:</p>
<pre><strong>sudo pip3 install scikit-surprise</strong></pre>
<p><strong>Bold</strong>: Indicates a new term, an important word, or w<span>ords that you see onscreen. For example, words in menus or dialog boxes appear in the text like this. Here is an example: "We see that the <kbd>u.user</kbd><em> </em>file contains demographic information about our users, such as their <span class="packt_screen">age</span>, <span class="packt_screen">sex</span>, <span class="packt_screen">occupation</span>, and <span class="packt_screen">zip_code</span>.</span><span>"</span></p>
<div class="packt_infobox">Warnings or important notes appear like this.</div>
<div class="packt_tip">Tips and tricks appear like this.</div>
