  <div id="sbo-rt-content"><div class="preface" title="Preface"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="pref05"/>Preface</h1></div></div></div><p>One could argue that it is a fortunate coincidence that you are holding this book in your hands (or have it on your eBook reader). After all, there are millions of books printed every year, which are read by millions of readers. And then there is this book read by you. One could also argue that a couple of machine learning algorithms played their role in leading you to this book—or this book to you. And we, the authors, are happy that you want to understand more about the hows and whys.</p><p>Most of the book will cover the <span class="emphasis"><em>how</em></span>. How has data to be processed so that machine learning algorithms can make the most out of it? How should one choose the right algorithm for a problem at hand?</p><p>Occasionally, we will also cover the <span class="emphasis"><em>why</em></span>. Why is it important to measure correctly? Why does one algorithm outperform another one in a given scenario?</p><p>We know that there is much more to learn to be an expert in the field. After all, we only covered some <span class="emphasis"><em>hows</em></span> and just a tiny fraction of the <span class="emphasis"><em>whys</em></span>. But in the end, we hope that this mixture will help you to get up and running as quickly as possible.</p><div class="section" title="What this book covers"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="ch00lvl1sec02"/>What this book covers</h1></div></div></div><p>
<a class="link" href="ch01.html" title="Chapter 1. Getting Started with Python Machine Learning">Chapter 1</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Getting Started with Python Machine Learning</em></span>, introduces the basic idea of machine learning with a very simple example. Despite its simplicity, it will challenge us with the risk of overfitting.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch02.html" title="Chapter 2. Classifying with Real-world Examples">Chapter 2</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Classifying with Real-world Examples</em></span>, uses real data to learn about classification, whereby we train a computer to be able to distinguish different classes of flowers.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch03.html" title="Chapter 3. Clustering – Finding Related Posts">Chapter 3</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Clustering – Finding Related Posts</em></span>, teaches how powerful the bag of words approach is, when we apply it to finding similar posts without really "understanding" them.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch04.html" title="Chapter 4. Topic Modeling">Chapter 4</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Topic Modeling</em></span>, moves beyond assigning each post to a single cluster and assigns them to several topics as a real text can deal with multiple topics.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch05.html" title="Chapter 5. Classification – Detecting Poor Answers">Chapter 5</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Classification – Detecting Poor Answers</em></span>, teaches how to use the bias-variance trade-off to debug machine learning models though this chapter is mainly on using a logistic regression to find whether a user's answer to a question is good or bad.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch06.html" title="Chapter 6. Classification II – Sentiment Analysis">Chapter 6</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Classification II – Sentiment Analysis</em></span>, explains how Naïve Bayes works, and how to use it to classify tweets to see whether they are positive or negative.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch07.html" title="Chapter 7. Regression">Chapter 7</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Regression</em></span>, explains how to use the classical topic, regression, in handling data, which is still relevant today. You will also learn about advanced regression techniques such as the Lasso and ElasticNets.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch08.html" title="Chapter 8. Recommendations">Chapter 8</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Recommendations</em></span>, builds recommendation systems based on costumer product ratings. We will also see how to build recommendations just from shopping data without the need for ratings data (which users do not always provide).</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch09.html" title="Chapter 9. Classification – Music Genre Classification">Chapter 9</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Classification – Music Genre Classification</em></span>, makes us pretend that someone has scrambled our huge music collection, and our only hope to create order is to let a machine learner classify our songs. It will turn out that it is sometimes better to trust someone else's expertise than creating features ourselves.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch10.html" title="Chapter 10. Computer Vision">Chapter 10</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Computer Vision</em></span>, teaches how to apply classification in the specific context of handling images by extracting features from data. We will also see how these methods can be adapted to find similar images in a collection.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch11.html" title="Chapter 11. Dimensionality Reduction">Chapter 11</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Dimensionality Reduction</em></span>, teaches us what other methods exist that can help us in downsizing data so that it is chewable by our machine learning algorithms.</p><p>
<a class="link" href="ch12.html" title="Chapter 12. Bigger Data">Chapter 12</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Bigger Data</em></span>, explores some approaches to deal with larger data by taking advantage of multiple cores or computing clusters. We also have an introduction to using cloud computing (using Amazon Web Services as our cloud provider).</p><p>
<a class="link" href="apa.html" title="Appendix A. Where to Learn More Machine Learning">Appendix</a>, <span class="emphasis"><em>Where to Learn More Machine Learning</em></span>, lists many wonderful resources available to learn more about machine learning.</p></div></div></div>

We will walk through the basic modes of machine learning based on realistic examples.</p><p>This book is also for machine learners who want to start using Python to build their systems. Python is a flexible language for rapid prototyping, while the underlying algorithms are all written in optimized C or C++. Thus the resulting code is fast and robust enough to be used in production as well.</p></div></div>
