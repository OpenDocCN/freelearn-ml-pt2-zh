# Embedding a Machine Learning Model into a Web Application

In the previous chapters, you learned about the many different machine learning concepts and algorithms that can help us with better and more efficient decision-making. However, machine learning techniques are not limited to offline applications and analyses, and they have become the predictive engine of various web services. For example, popular and useful applications of machine learning models in web applications include spam detection in submission forms, search engines, recommendation systems for media or shopping portals, and many more.

In this chapter, you will learn how to embed a machine learning model into a web application that can not only classify, but also learn from data in real time. The topics that we will cover are as follows:

*   Saving the current state of a trained machine learning model
*   Using SQLite databases for data storage
*   Developing a web application using the popular Flask web framework
*   Deploying a machine learning application to a public web server

# Serializing fitted scikit-learn estimators

Training a machine learning model can be computationally expensive, as you saw in *Chapter 8*, *Applying Machine Learning to Sentiment Analysis*. Surely, we don't want to retrain our model every time we close our Python interpreter and want to make a new prediction or reload our web application?

One option for model persistence is Python's in-built `pickle` module ([https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/pickle.html)), which allows us to serialize and deserialize Python object structures to compact bytecode so that we can save our classifier in its current state and reload it if we want to classify new, unlabeled examples, without needing the model to learn from the training data all over again. Before you execute the following code, please make sure that you have trained the out-of-core logistic regression model from the last section of *Chapter 8* and have it ready in your current Python session:

[PRE0]

Using the preceding code, we created a `movieclassifier` directory where we will later store the files and data for our web application. Within this `movieclassifier` directory, we created a `pkl_objects` subdirectory to save the serialized Python objects to our local hard drive or solid-state drive. Via the `dump` method of the `pickle` module, we then serialized the trained logistic regression model as well as the stop-word set from the **Natural Language Toolkit** (**NLTK**) library, so that we don't have to install the NLTK vocabulary on our server.

The `dump` method takes as its first argument the object that we want to pickle. For the second argument, we provided an open file object that the Python object will be written to. Via the `wb` argument inside the `open` function, we opened the file in binary mode for pickle, and we set `protocol=4` to choose the latest and most efficient pickle protocol that was added to Python 3.4, which is compatible with Python 3.4 or newer. If you have problems using `protocol=4`, please check whether you are using the latest Python 3 versionâ€”Python 3.7 is recommended for this book. Alternatively, you may consider choosing a lower protocol number.

Also note that if you are using a custom web server, you have to ensure that the Python installation on that server is compatible with this protocol version as well.

**Serializing NumPy arrays with joblib**

Our logistic regression model contains several NumPy arrays, such as the weight vector, and a more efficient way to serialize NumPy arrays is to use the alternative `joblib` library. To ensure compatibility with the server environment that we will use in later sections, we will use the standard pickle approach. If you are interested, you can find more information about `joblib` at [https://joblib.readthedocs.io](https://joblib.readthedocs.io).

We don't need to pickle `HashingVectorizer`, since it does not need to be fitted. Instead, we can create a new Python script file from which we can import the vectorizer into our current Python session. Now, copy the following code and save it as `vectorizer.py` in the `movieclassifier` directory:

[PRE1]

After we have pickled the Python objects and created the `vectorizer.py` file, it would be a good idea to restart our Python interpreter or Jupyter Notebook kernel to test whether we can deserialize the objects without error.

**Pickle can be a security risk**

Please note that unpickling data from an untrusted source can be a potential security risk, since the `pickle` module is not secured against malicious code. Since `pickle` was designed to serialize arbitrary objects, the unpickling process will execute code that has been stored in a pickle file. Thus, if you receive pickle files from an untrusted source (for example, by downloading them from the internet), please proceed with extra care and unpickle the items in a virtual environment and/or on a non-essential machine that does not store important data that no one except you should have access to.

From your terminal, navigate to the `movieclassifier` directory, start a new Python session, and execute the following code to verify that you can import the `vectorizer` and unpickle the classifier:

[PRE2]

After we have successfully loaded the `vectorizer` and unpickled the classifier, we can use these objects to preprocess document examples and make predictions about their sentiments:

[PRE3]

Since our classifier returns the class label predictions as integers, we defined a simple Python dictionary to map these integers to their sentiment (`"positive"` or `"negative"`). While this is a simple application with two classes only, it should be noted that this dictionary-mapping approach also generalizes to multiclass settings. Furthermore, this mapping dictionary should also be archived alongside the model.

In this case, since the dictionary definition only consists of one line of code, we will not go to the trouble of serializing it using pickle. However, in real-world applications with more extensive mapping dictionaries, you can utilize the same `pickle.dump` and `pickle.load` commands that we used in the previous code example.

Continuing with the discussion of the previous code example, we then used `HashingVectorizer` to transform the simple example document into a word vector, `X`. Finally, we used the `predict` method of the logistic regression classifier to predict the class label, as well as the `predict_proba` method to return the corresponding probability of our prediction. Note that the `predict_proba` method call returns an array with a probability value for each unique class label. Since the class label with the largest probability corresponds to the class label that is returned by the `predict` call, we used the `np.max` function to return the probability of the predicted class.

# Setting up an SQLite database for data storage

In this section, we will set up a simple SQLite database to collect optional feedback about the predictions from users of the web application. We can use this feedback to update our classification model. SQLite is an open source SQL database engine that doesn't require a separate server to operate, which makes it ideal for smaller projects and simple web applications. Essentially, an SQLite database can be understood as a single, self-contained database file that allows us to directly access storage files.

Furthermore, SQLite doesn't require any system-specific configuration and is supported by all common operating systems. It has gained a reputation for being very reliable and is used by popular companies such as Google, Mozilla, Adobe, Apple, Microsoft, and many more. If you want to learn more about SQLite, visit the official website at [http://www.sqlite.org](http://www.sqlite.org).

Fortunately, following Python's *batteries included* philosophy, there is already an API in the Python standard library, `sqlite3`, which allows us to work with SQLite databases. (For more information about `sqlite3`, please visit [https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sqlite3.html](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/sqlite3.html).)

By executing the following code, we will create a new SQLite database inside the `movieclassifier` directory and store two example movie reviews:

[PRE4]

Following the preceding code example, we created a connection (`conn`) to an SQLite database file by calling the `connect` method of the `sqlite3` library, which created the new database file `reviews.sqlite` in the `movieclassifier` directory if it didn't already exist.

Next, we created a cursor via the `cursor` method, which allows us to traverse over the database records using the versatile SQL syntax. Via the first `execute` call, we then created a new database table, `review_db`. We used this to store and access database entries. Along with `review_db`, we also created three columns in this database table: `review`, `sentiment`, and `date`. We used these to store two example movie reviews and respective class labels (sentiments).

Using the `DATETIME('now')` SQL command, we also added date and timestamps to our entries. In addition to the timestamps, we used the question mark symbols (`?`) to pass the movie review texts (`example1` and `example2`) and the corresponding class labels (`1` and `0`) as positional arguments to the `execute` method, as members of a tuple. Lastly, we called the `commit` method to save the changes that we made to the database and closed the connection via the `close` method.

To check if the entries have been stored in the database table correctly, we will now reopen the connection to the database and use the SQL `SELECT` command to fetch all rows in the database table that have been committed between the beginning of the year 2017 and today:

[PRE5]

Alternatively, we could also use the free DB browser for SQLite app (available at [https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/](https://sqlitebrowser.org/dl/)), which offers a nice graphical user interface for working with SQLite databases, as shown in the following figure:

![](img/B13208_09_01.png)

# Developing a web application with Flask

Having prepared the code for classifying movie reviews in the previous subsection, let's discuss the basics of the Flask web framework to develop our web application. Since Armin Ronacher's initial release of Flask in 2010, the framework has gained huge popularity, and examples of popular applications that use Flask include LinkedIn and Pinterest. Since Flask is written in Python, it provides us Python programmers with a convenient interface for embedding existing Python code, such as our movie classifier.

**The Flask microframework**

Flask is also known as a **microframework**, which means that its core is kept lean and simple but it can be easily extended with other libraries. Although the learning curve of the lightweight Flask API is not nearly as steep as those of other popular Python web frameworks, such as Django, you are encouraged to take a look at the official Flask documentation at [https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.0.x/) to learn more about its functionality.

If the Flask library is not already installed in your current Python environment, you can simply install it via `conda` or `pip` from your terminal (at the time of writing, the latest stable release was version 1.0.2):

[PRE6]

## Our first Flask web application

In this subsection, we will develop a very simple web application to become more familiar with the Flask API before we implement our movie classifier. This first application that we are going to build consists of a simple web page with a form field that lets us enter a name. After submitting the name to the web application, it will render it on a new page. While this is a very simple example of a web application, it helps with building an understanding of how to store and pass variables and values between the different parts of our code within the Flask framework.

First, we create a directory tree:

[PRE7]

The `app.py` file will contain the main code that will be executed by the Python interpreter to run the Flask web application. The `templates` directory is the directory in which Flask will look for static HTML files for rendering in the web browser. Let's now take a look at the contents of `app.py`:

[PRE8]

After looking at the previous code example, let's discuss the individual pieces step by step:

1.  We ran our application as a single module; thus, we initialized a new Flask instance with the argument `__name__` to let Flask know that it can find the HTML template folder (`templates`) in the same directory where it is located.
2.  Next, we used the route decorator (`@app.route('/')`) to specify the URL that should trigger the execution of the `index` function.
3.  Here, our `index` function simply rendered the `first_app.html` HTML file, which is located in the `templates` folder.
4.  Lastly, we used the `run` function to run the application on the server only when this script was directly executed by the Python interpreter, which we ensured using the `if` statement with `__name__ == '__main__'`.

Now, let's take a look at the contents of the `first_app.html` file:

[PRE9]

**HTML basics**

If you are not familiar with the HTML syntax yet, visit [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) for useful tutorials on learning the basics of HTML.

Here, we have simply filled an empty HTML template file with a `<div>` element (a block-level element) that contains this sentence: `Hi, this is my first Flask web app!`.

Conveniently, Flask allows us to run our applications locally, which is useful for developing and testing web applications before we deploy them on a public web server. Now, let's start our web application by executing the command from the terminal inside the `1st_flask_app_1` directory:

[PRE10]

We should see a line such as the following displayed in the terminal:

[PRE11]

This line contains the address of our local server. We can enter this address in our web browser to see the web application in action.

If everything has executed correctly, we should see a simple website with the content `Hi, this is my first Flask web app!` as shown in the following figure:

![](img/B13208_09_02.png)

## Form validation and rendering

In this subsection, we will extend our simple Flask web application with HTML form elements to learn how to collect data from a user using the WTForms library ([https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/](https://wtforms.readthedocs.org/en/latest/)), which can be installed via `conda` or `pip`:

[PRE12]

This web application will prompt a user to type in his or her name into a text field, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](img/B13208_09_03.png)

After the submission button (**Say Hello**) has been clicked and the form has been validated, a new HTML page will be rendered to display the user's name:

![](img/B13208_09_04.png)

### Setting up the directory structure

The new directory structure that we need to set up for this application looks like this:

[PRE13]

The following are the contents of our modified `app.py` file:

[PRE14]

Let's discuss what the previous code does step by step:

1.  Using `wtforms`, we extended the `index` function with a text field that we will embed in our start page using the `TextAreaField` class, which automatically checks whether a user has provided valid input text or not.
2.  Furthermore, we defined a new function, `hello`, which will render an HTML page, `hello.html`, after validating the HTML form.
3.  Here, we used the `POST` method to transport the form data to the server in the message body. Finally, by setting the `debug=True` argument inside the `app.run` method, we further activated Flask's debugger. This is a useful feature for developing new web applications.

### Implementing a macro using the Jinja2 templating engine

Now, we will implement a generic macro in the `_formhelpers.html` file via the Jinja2 templating engine, which we will later import in our `first_app.html` file to render the text field:

[PRE15]

An in-depth discussion about the Jinja2 templating language is beyond the scope of this book. However, you can find comprehensive documentation on the Jinja2 syntax at [http://jinja.pocoo.org](http://jinja.pocoo.org).

### Adding style via CSS

Next, we will set up a simple **Cascading Style Sheets** (**CSS**) file, `style.css`, to demonstrate how the look and feel of HTML documents can be modified. We have to save the following CSS file, which will simply double the font size of our HTML body elements, in a subdirectory called `static`, which is the default directory where Flask looks for static files such as CSS. The file content is as follows:

[PRE16]

The following are the contents of the modified `first_app.html` file that will now render a text form where a user can enter a name:

[PRE17]

In the header section of `first_app.html`, we loaded the CSS file. It should now alter the size of all text elements in the HTML body. In the HTML body section, we imported the form macro from `_formhelpers.html`, and we rendered the `sayhello` form that we specified in the `app.py` file. Furthermore, we added a button to the same form element so that a user can submit the text field entry. The changes between the original and modified `first_app.html` file are illustrated in the following figure:

![](img/B13208_09_05.png)

### Creating the result page

Lastly, we will create a `hello.html` file that will be rendered via the `render_template('hello.html', name=name)` line return inside the `hello` function, which we defined in the `app.py` script to display the text that a user submitted via the text field. The file content is as follows:

[PRE18]

Since we have covered a lot of ground in the previous section, the following figure provides an overview of the files we have created:

![](img/B13208_09_06.png)

Please note that you do not need to copy any code from the previous figure, since all file contents are present in the previous sections. For your convenience, copies of all files can also be found online at [https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/tree/master/ch09/1st_flask_app_2](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/tree/master/ch09/1st_flask_app_2).

Having set up our modified Flask web application, we can run it locally by executing the following command from the application's main directory:

[PRE19]

Then, to see the resulting web page, enter the IP address shown in your terminal, which is usually `http://127.0.0.1:5000/,` into your web browser to view the rendered web app as summarized in the following figure:

![](img/B13208_09_07.png)

**Flask documentation and examples**

If you are new to web development, some of those concepts may seem very complicated at first sight. In that case, simply set up the preceding files in a directory on your hard drive and examine them closely. You will see that the Flask web framework is relatively straightforward and much simpler than it might initially appear! Also, for more help, don't forget to consult the excellent Flask documentation and examples at [http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/).

# Turning the movie review classifier into a web application

Now that we are somewhat familiar with the basics of Flask web development, let's advance to the next step and implement our movie classifier into a web application. In this section, we will develop a web application that will first prompt a user to enter a movie review, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](img/B13208_09_08.png)

After the review has been submitted, the user will see a new page that shows the predicted class label and the probability of the prediction. Furthermore, the user will be able to provide feedback about this prediction by clicking on the **Correct** or **Incorrect** button, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](img/B13208_09_09.png)

If a user clicked on either the **Correct** or **Incorrect** button, our classification model will be updated with respect to the user's feedback. Furthermore, we will also store the movie review text provided by the user, as well as the suggested class label, which can be inferred from the button click, in an SQLite database for future reference. (Alternatively, a user could skip the update step and click the **Submit another review** button to submit another review.)

The third page that the user will see after clicking on one of the feedback buttons is a simple *thank you* screen with a **Submit another review** button that redirects the user back to the start page. This is shown in the following screenshot:

![](img/B13208_09_10.png)

**Live demo**

Before we take a closer look at the code implementation of this web application, take a look at this live demo at [http://raschkas.pythonanywhere.com](http://raschkas.pythonanywhere.com) to get a better understanding of what we are trying to accomplish in this section.

## Files and folders â€“ looking at the directory tree

To start with the big picture, let's take a look at the directory tree that we are going to create for this movie classification application, which is shown here:

![](img/B13208_09_11.png)

Earlier in this chapter, we created the `vectorizer.py` file, the SQLite database, `reviews.sqlite`, and the `pkl_objects` subdirectory with the pickled Python objects.

The `app.py` file in the main directory is the Python script that contains our Flask code, and we will use the `review.sqlite` database file (which we created earlier in this chapter) to store the movie reviews that are being submitted to our web application. The `templates` subdirectory contains the HTML templates that will be rendered by Flask and displayed in the browser, and the `static` subdirectory will contain a simple CSS file to adjust the look of the rendered HTML code.

**Getting the movieclassifier code files**

A separate directory containing the movie review classifier application with the code discussed in this section is provided with the code examples for this book, which you can either obtain directly from Packt or download from GitHub at [https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition/). The code in this section can be found in the `.../code/ch09/movieclassifier` subdirectory.

## Implementing the main application as app.py

Since the `app.py` file is rather long, we will conquer it in two steps. The first section of `app.py` imports the Python modules and objects that we are going to need, as well as the code to unpickle and set up our classification model:

[PRE20]

This first part of the `app.py` script should look very familiar by now. We simply imported `HashingVectorizer` and unpickled the logistic regression classifier. Next, we defined a `classify` function to return the predicted class label, as well as the corresponding probability prediction of a given text document. The `train` function can be used to update the classifier, given that a document and a class label are provided.

Using the `sqlite_entry` function, we can store a submitted movie review in our SQLite database along with its class label and timestamp for our personal records. Note that the `clf` object will be reset to its original, pickled state if we restart the web application. At the end of this chapter, you will learn how to use the data that we collect in the SQLite database to update the classifier permanently.

The concepts in the second part of the `app.py` script should also look quite familiar:

[PRE21]

We defined a `ReviewForm` class that instantiates a `TextAreaField`, which will be rendered in the `reviewform.html` template file (the landing page of our web application). This, in turn, will be rendered by the `index` function. With the `validators.length(min=15)` parameter, we require the user to enter a review that contains at least 15 characters. Inside the `results` function, we fetch the contents of the submitted web form and pass it on to our classifier to predict the sentiment of the movie classifier, which will then be displayed in the rendered `results.html` template.

The `feedback` function, which we implemented in `app.py` in the previous subsection, may look a little bit complicated at first glance. It essentially fetches the predicted class label from the `results.html` template if a user clicked on the **Correct** or **Incorrect** feedback button, and it transforms the predicted sentiment back into an integer class label that will be used to update the classifier via the `train` function, which we implemented in the first section of the `app.py` script. Also, a new entry to the SQLite database will be made via the `sqlite_entry` function if feedback was provided, and eventually, the `thanks.html` template will be rendered to thank the user for the feedback.

## Setting up the review form

Next, let's take a look at the `reviewform.html` template, which constitutes the starting page of our application:

[PRE22]

Here, we simply imported the same `_formhelpers.html` template that we defined in the *Form validation and rendering* section earlier in this chapter. The `render_field` function of this macro is used to render a `TextAreaField` where a user can provide a movie review and submit it via the **Submit review** button displayed at the bottom of the page. This `TextAreaField` is 30 columns wide and 10 rows tall, and will look like this:

![](img/B13208_09_12.png)

## Creating a results page template

Our next template, `results.html`, looks a little bit more interesting:

[PRE23]

First, we inserted the submitted review, as well as the results of the prediction, in the corresponding fields `{{ content }}`, `{{ prediction }}`, and `{{ probability }}`. You may notice that we used the `{{ content }}` and `{{ prediction }}` placeholder variables (in this context, also known as *hidden fields*) a second time in the form that contains the **Correct** and **Incorrect** buttons. This is a workaround to `POST` those values back to the server to update the classifier and store the review in case the user clicks on one of those two buttons.

Furthermore, we imported a CSS file (`style.css`) at the beginning of the `results.html` file. The setup of this file is quite simple: it limits the width of the contents of this web application to 600 pixels and moves the **Incorrect** and **Correct** buttons labeled with the div id `button` down by 20 pixels:

[PRE24]

This CSS file is merely a placeholder, so please feel free to modify it to adjust the look and feel of the web application to your liking.

The last HTML file we will implement for our web application is the `thanks.html` template. As the name suggests, it simply provides a nice *thank you* message to the user after providing feedback via the **Correct** or **Incorrect** button. Furthermore, we will put a **Submit another review** button at the bottom of this page, which will redirect the user to the starting page. The contents of the `thanks.html` file are as follows:

[PRE25]

Now, it would be a good idea to start the web application locally from our command-line terminal via the following command before we advance to the next subsection and deploy it on a public web server:

[PRE26]

After we have finished testing our application, we also shouldn't forget to remove the `debug=True` argument in the `app.run()` command of our `app.py` script (or set `debug=False` ) as illustrated in the following figure:

![](img/B13208_09_13.png)

# Deploying the web application to a public server

After we have tested the web application locally, we are now ready to deploy our web application onto a public web server. For this tutorial, we will be using the PythonAnywhere web hosting service, which specializes in the hosting of Python web applications and makes it extremely simple and hassle-free. Furthermore, PythonAnywhere offers a beginner account option that lets us run a single web application free of charge.

## Creating a PythonAnywhere account

To create a new PythonAnywhere account, we visit the website at [https://www.pythonanywhere.com/](https://www.pythonanywhere.com/) and click on the **Pricing & signup** link that is located in the top-right corner. Next, we click on the **Create a Beginner account** button where we need to provide a username, password, and valid email address. After we have read and agreed to the terms and conditions, we should have a new account.

Unfortunately, the free beginner account doesn't allow us to access the remote server via the Secure Socket Shell (SSH) protocol from our terminal. Thus, we need to use the PythonAnywhere web interface to manage our web application. But before we can upload our local application files to the server, we need to create a new web application for our PythonAnywhere account. After we click on the **Dashboard** button in the top-right corner, we have access to the control panel shown at the top of the page. Next, we click on the **Web** tab that is now visible at the top of the page. We proceed by clicking on the **+Add a new web app** button on the left, which lets us create a new Python 3.7 Flask web application that we name `movieclassifier`.

## Uploading the movie classifier application

After creating a new application for our PythonAnywhere account, we head over to the **Files** tab to upload the files from our local `movieclassifier` directory using the PythonAnywhere web interface. After uploading the web application files that we created locally on our computer, we should have a `movieclassifier` directory in our PythonAnywhere account. It will contain the same directories and files as our local `movieclassifier` directory, as shown in the following screenshot:

![](img/B13208_09_14.png)

Then, we head over to the **Web** tab one more time and click on the **Reload <username>.pythonanywhere.com** button to propagate the changes and refresh our web application. Finally, our web application should now be up and running and publicly available via `<username>.pythonanywhere.com`.

**Troubleshooting**

Unfortunately, web servers can be quite sensitive to the tiniest problems in our web application. If you are experiencing problems with running the web application on PythonAnywhere and are receiving error messages in your browser, you can check the server and error logs, which can be accessed from the **Web** tab in your PythonAnywhere account, to better diagnose the problem.

## Updating the movie classifier

While our predictive model is updated on the fly whenever a user provides feedback about the classification, the updates to the `clf` object will be reset if the web server crashes or restarts. If we reload the web application, the `clf` object will be reinitialized from the `classifier.pkl` pickle file. One option to apply the updates permanently would be to pickle the `clf` object once again after each update. However, this would become computationally very inefficient with a growing number of users and could corrupt the pickle file if users provide feedback simultaneously.

An alternative solution is to update the predictive model from the feedback data that is being collected in the SQLite database. One option would be to download the SQLite database from the PythonAnywhere server, update the `clf` object locally on our computer, and upload the new pickle file to PythonAnywhere. To update the classifier locally on our computer, we create an `update.py` script file in the `movieclassifier` directory with the following contents:

[PRE27]

**Getting the movieclassifier code files with the update functionality**

A separate directory containing the movie review classifier application with the update functionality discussed in this chapter comes with the code examples for this book, which you can either obtain directly from Packt or download from GitHub at [https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition](https://github.com/rasbt/python-machine-learning-book-3rd-edition). The code in this section is located in the `.../code/ch09/movieclassifier_with_update` subdirectory.

The `update_model` function will fetch entries from the SQLite database in batches of 10,000 entries at a time, unless the database contains fewer entries. Alternatively, we could also fetch one entry at a time by using `fetchone` instead of `fetchmany`, which would be computationally very inefficient. However, keep in mind that using the alternative `fetchall` method could be a problem if we are working with large datasets that exceed the computer or server's memory capacity.

Now that we have created the `update.py` script, we could also upload it to the `movieclassifier` directory on PythonAnywhere and import the `update_model` function in the main application script, `app.py`, to update the classifier from the SQLite database every time we restart the web application. In order to do so, we just need to add a line of code to import the `update_model` function from the `update.py` script at the top of `app.py`:

[PRE28]

We then need to call the `update_model` function in the main application body:

[PRE29]

As discussed, the modification in the previous code snippet will update the pickle file on PythonAnywhere. However, in practice, we do not often have to restart our web application, and it would make sense to validate the user feedback in the SQLite database prior to the update to make sure that the feedback is valuable information for the classifier.

**Creating backups**

In a real-world application, you may also want to back up the `classifier.pkl` pickle file periodically to have a safeguard against file corruption, for instance, by creating a timestamped version prior to each update. In order to create backups of the pickled classifier, you can import the following:

Then, above the code that updates the pickled classifier, which is as follows,

As a consequence, backup files of the pickled classifier will be created following the format `YearMonthDay-HourMinuteSecond`, for example, `classifier_20190822-092148.pkl`.

# Summary

In this chapter, you learned about many useful and practical topics that will extend your knowledge of machine learning theory. You learned how to serialize a model after training and how to load it for later use cases. Furthermore, we created an SQLite database for efficient data storage and created a web application that lets us make our movie classifier available to the outside world.

So far, in this book, we have covered many machine learning concepts, best practices, and supervised models for classification. In the next chapter, we will take a look at another subcategory of supervised learning, regression analysis, which lets us predict outcome variables on a continuous scale, in contrast to the categorical class labels of the classification models that we have been working with so far.
